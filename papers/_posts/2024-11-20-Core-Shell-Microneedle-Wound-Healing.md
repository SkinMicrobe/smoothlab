# Abstract

Wound healing is a dynamic process involving the timely transition of organized phases. However, infected wounds often experience prolonged inflammation due to microbial overload. Thus, addressing the viable treatment needs across different healing stages is a critical challenge in wound management. Herein, a novel core-shell microneedle (CSMN) patch is designed for the sequential delivery of tannic acid-magnesium (TA-Mg) complexes and extracellular vesicles from Lactobacillus druckerii (LDEVs). Upon application to infected sites, CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV releases TA-Mg first to counteract pathogenic overload and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), aiding the transition to proliferative phase. Subsequently, the sustained release of LDEVs enhances the activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, promotes vascularization, and modulates the collagen deposition. Notably, dynamic track of microbial composition demonstrates that CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV can both inhibit the aggressive pathogen and increase the microbial diversity at wound sites. Functional analysis further highlights the potential of CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV in facilitating wound healing and skin barrier restoration. Moreover, it is confirmed that CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV can accelerate wound closure and improve post-recovery skin quality in the murine infected wound. Conclusively, this innovative CSMN patch offers a rapid and high-quality alternative treatment for infected wounds and emphasizes the significance of microbial homeostasis.
