# Abstract

Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation influenced by dysregulated skin microbiota, with the role of microbiota in psoriasis gaining increasing prominence. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) serve as crucial regulators in the interaction between hosts and microbiota. However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of bEVs from commensal bacteria in psoriasis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the therapeutic role of Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes)-derived extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) in psoriasis treatment. To prolong the active duration of CA-EVs, we encapsulated them in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) to fabricate hydrogel microspheres (CA-EVs@GHM) with sustained release properties. As GelMA degraded, CA-EVs were gradually released, maintaining a high concentration in mouse skin even 96 h post-treatment. In human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), CA-EVs@GHM enhanced resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), promoted proliferation and migration of HaCaT cells exposed to S. aureus, and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8). In vivo, CA-EVs@GHM, more potent than CA-EVs alone, markedly attenuated proinflammatory gene expression, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Il6, Il17a, Il22 and Il23a in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mice, and restored skin barrier function. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that CA-EVs@GHM might provide therapeutic effects against psoriasis by restoring microbiota diversity on the back skin of mice, reducing Staphylococcus colonization, and augmenting lipid metabolism. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-EVs@GHM prevented the conversion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) to type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in psoriasis-like mouse skin, reducing the pathogenic ILC3 population and suppressing the secretion of IL-17 and IL-22. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the long-term sustained release of CA-EVs alleviated psoriasis symptoms by controlling the transformation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) subgroups and restoring skin microbiota homeostasis, thus offering a promising therapy for psoriasis treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cutibacterium acnes, which is reduced in psoriasis skin, has been reported to promote skin homeostasis by regulating immune balance. Compared to live bacteria, bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) are less prone to toxicity and safety concerns. bEVs play a pivotal role in maintaining bacterial homeostasis and modulating the immune system. However,bEVs without sustained release materials are unable to function continuously in chronic diseases. Therefore, we utilized hydrogel microspheres to encapsulate Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes)-derived extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs), enabling long term sustained release. Our findings indicate that, CA-EVs loaded gelatin methacrylate hydrogel microspheres (CA-EVs@GHM) showed superior therapeutic effects in treating psoriasis compared to CA-EVs. CA-EVs@GHM exhibited a more significant regulation of pathological type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and skin microbiota, providing a promising approach for microbiota-derived extracellular vesicle therapy in the treatment of skin inflammation.
