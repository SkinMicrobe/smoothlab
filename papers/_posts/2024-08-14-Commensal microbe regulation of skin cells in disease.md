# Abstract

Human skin is the host to various commensal microbes that constitute a substantial microbial community. The reciprocal communication between these microbial inhabitants and host cells upholds both the morphological and functional attributes of the skin layers, contributing indispensably to microenvironmental and tissue homeostasis. Thus, disruption of the skin barrier or imbalances in the microbial communities can exert profound effects on the behavior of host cells. This influence, mediated by the microbes themselves or their metabolites, manifests in diverse outcomes. In this review, we examine existing knowledge to provide insight into the nuanced behavior exhibited by the microbiota on skin cells in health and disease states. These interactions provide insight into potential cellular targets for future microbiota-based therapies to prevent and treat skin disease.
