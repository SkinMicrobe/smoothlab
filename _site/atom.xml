&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background
Barrier dysfunction and dysbiosis of the skin microbiota are two of the key factors in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). Phytic acid (PA) is a common constituent of high-fiber foods, whereas its role in AD remains unelucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PA-altered skin microbial metabolites on AD and to explore its specific mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods
MC903-induced AD mouse models were used to explore the role of PA on AD by TEWL, immunofluorescence, and qPCR analysis. Using cohouse experiments with feces removal to verify the role of skin microbiota. The specific mechanism of effect of PA was explored through 16S, RNA-seq, LC–MS/MS, luciferase assay, and in vivo experiments with siRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results
Diet-derived PA significantly improved the barrier function of MC903-induced AD, whether administered by gavage or topically. Topical application of PA reshaped the skin microbiota in AD mice and increased tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, PA upregulated skin microbiota-derived indole derivatives, especially indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), thus activating AHR to promote the transcription of KRT10, which further ameliorated AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
Our findings showed that diet-derived PA improved barrier function in AD via altering skin microbiota-derived metabolites, highlighting PA as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences cancer prognosis and therapeutic outcomes, yet its composition remains highly heterogeneous, and currently, no highly accessible, high‐throughput method exists to define it. To address this complexity, the TMEclassifier, a machine‐learning tool that classifies cancers into three distinct subtypes: immune Exclusive (IE), immune Suppressive (IS), and immune Activated (IA), is developed. Bulk RNA sequencing categorizes patient samples by TME subtype, and in vivo mouse model validates TME subtype differences and differential responses to immunotherapy. The IE subtype is marked by high stromal cell abundance, associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes. The IS subtype features myeloid‐derived suppressor cell infiltration, intensifying immunosuppression. In contrast, the IA subtype, often linked to EBV/MSI, exhibits robust T‐cell presence and improved immunotherapy response. Single‐cell RNA sequencing is applied to explore TME cellular heterogeneity, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that targeting IL‐1 counteracts immunosuppression of IS subtype and markedly improves its responsiveness to immunotherapy. TMEclassifier predictions are validated in this prospective gastric cancer cohort (TIMES‐001) and other diverse cohorts. This classifier could effectively stratify patients, guiding personalized immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance precision and overcome resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incidence of allergic diseases has continued to rise in recent years, affecting approximately 20% of the worldwide population especially children. Allergic diseases are chronic immune diseases that greatly reduce the quality of life of patients, leading to great economic and medical burden. The epidemiological studies indicated that children who had atopic dermatitis (AD) in infancy are more likely to develop food allergy (FA) later, and then allergic asthma (AA) and allergic rhinitis (AR) in childhood, which was defined as the “atopic march” (AM). Anatomically, AM follows a spatial sequence from the skin to the gastrointestinal tract and then to the respiratory tract. Although the mechanisms underlying AM remain to be elucidated, microbiome alteration was considered as a critical cause. The skin and gut are the 2 main habitats of microbiota, and research in recent decades has also indicated the presence of bacteria in the lungs. We here not only summarized the roles of the skin, gut, lung microbiota in AD, FA, and AA, respectively, but also investigated the crosstalk effects of microbiota in each anatomic site on remote organs, including the microbiota-gut-skin axis, microbiota-gut-lung axis, and microbiota-skin-lung axis. In addition, we proposed the limitations of current research and the direction of future research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Melatonin treatment increases skin microbiota-derived propionic acid to alleviate atopic dermatitis​</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/Melatonin-treatment-increases-skin-microbiota"/>
   <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: Melatonin has been reported to relieve the inflammatory symptoms and improve sleep disturbance in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Recent studies showed that melatonin produced beneficial effects by remodeling intestinal microbiota composition; however, whether the beneficial effects of melatonin in AD were mediated by the modulation of skin microbiota remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: We sought to investigate the mechanism by which melatonin treatment-induced changes in the skin microbiota composition further alleviated AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: The changes in skin bacterial composition after melatonin treatment were detected by 16S-rRNA sequencing. Further mechanisms were explored in calcipotriol (MC903)-induced AD mice and HaCaT cells through skin microbiota transplantation, quantification detection of short-chain fatty acids, transcriptome and single-cell sequencing analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: We demonstrated that melatonin reshaped the skin microbiota in AD mice. The transplantation of skin microbiota from melatonin-treated mice alleviated AD symptoms in mice. Skin microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids, especially propionic acid, were increased in the skin of melatonin-treated AD mice, which further inhibited FABP5 expression to alleviate AD. Propionic acid also inhibited FABP5 expression in HaCaT cells, which was reversed by the treatment of GPR43 inhibitor GLPG0974. GLPG0974 also blocked the therapeutic effects of melatonin on AD mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that melatonin alleviates AD through the skin microbiota/propionic acid/GPR43/FABP5 axis, highlighting a novel role of melatonin as a modulator of skin microbiota to alleviate AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in understanding the modulatory functions of gut and gut microbiota on human diseases facilitated our focused attention on the contribution of the gut to the pathophysiological alterations of many extraintestinal organs, including the liver, heart, brain, lungs, kidneys, bone, skin, reproductive, and endocrine systems. In this review, we applied the “gut-X axis” concept to describe the linkages between the gut and other organs and discussed the latest findings related to the “gut-X axis,” including the underlying modulatory mechanisms and potential clinical intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of large transcriptome datasets has greatly improved our understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and helped develop precise immunotherapies. The growing application of multi-omics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptome sequencing has led to many new insights, yet these findings still require clinical validation in large cohorts. To advance multi-omics integration in TME research, we have upgraded the Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR) package to IOBR 2.0, restructuring and standardizing its analytical workflow. IOBR 2.0 offers six modules for TME analysis based on multi-omics data, including data preprocessing, TME estimation, TME infiltration pattern identification, cellular interaction analysis, genome and TME interaction, and feature visualization, as well as modeling. Additionally, IOBR 2.0 enables constructing gene signatures and reference matrices from scRNA-seq data for TME deconvolution. The user-friendly pipeline provides comprehensive insights into tumor-immune interactions, and a detailed GitBook(https://iobr.github.io/book/) offers a complete manual and analysis guide for each module.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wound healing is a dynamic process involving the timely transition of organized phases. However, infected wounds often experience prolonged inflammation due to microbial overload. Thus, addressing the viable treatment needs across different healing stages is a critical challenge in wound management. Herein, a novel core-shell microneedle (CSMN) patch is designed for the sequential delivery of tannic acid-magnesium (TA-Mg) complexes and extracellular vesicles from Lactobacillus druckerii (LDEVs). Upon application to infected sites, CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV releases TA-Mg first to counteract pathogenic overload and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), aiding the transition to proliferative phase. Subsequently, the sustained release of LDEVs enhances the activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, promotes vascularization, and modulates the collagen deposition. Notably, dynamic track of microbial composition demonstrates that CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV can both inhibit the aggressive pathogen and increase the microbial diversity at wound sites. Functional analysis further highlights the potential of CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV in facilitating wound healing and skin barrier restoration. Moreover, it is confirmed that CSMN@TA-Mg/LDEV can accelerate wound closure and improve post-recovery skin quality in the murine infected wound. Conclusively, this innovative CSMN patch offers a rapid and high-quality alternative treatment for infected wounds and emphasizes the significance of microbial homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human skin is the host to various commensal microbes that constitute a substantial microbial community. The reciprocal communication between these microbial inhabitants and host cells upholds both the morphological and functional attributes of the skin layers, contributing indispensably to microenvironmental and tissue homeostasis. Thus, disruption of the skin barrier or imbalances in the microbial communities can exert profound effects on the behavior of host cells. This influence, mediated by the microbes themselves or their metabolites, manifests in diverse outcomes. In this review, we examine existing knowledge to provide insight into the nuanced behavior exhibited by the microbiota on skin cells in health and disease states. These interactions provide insight into potential cellular targets for future microbiota-based therapies to prevent and treat skin disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation influenced by dysregulated skin microbiota, with the role of microbiota in psoriasis gaining increasing prominence. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) serve as crucial regulators in the interaction between hosts and microbiota. However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of bEVs from commensal bacteria in psoriasis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the therapeutic role of Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes)-derived extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) in psoriasis treatment. To prolong the active duration of CA-EVs, we encapsulated them in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) to fabricate hydrogel microspheres (CA-EVs@GHM) with sustained release properties. As GelMA degraded, CA-EVs were gradually released, maintaining a high concentration in mouse skin even 96 h post-treatment. In human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), CA-EVs@GHM enhanced resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), promoted proliferation and migration of HaCaT cells exposed to S. aureus, and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8). In vivo, CA-EVs@GHM, more potent than CA-EVs alone, markedly attenuated proinflammatory gene expression, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Il6, Il17a, Il22 and Il23a in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mice, and restored skin barrier function. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that CA-EVs@GHM might provide therapeutic effects against psoriasis by restoring microbiota diversity on the back skin of mice, reducing Staphylococcus colonization, and augmenting lipid metabolism. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-EVs@GHM prevented the conversion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) to type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in psoriasis-like mouse skin, reducing the pathogenic ILC3 population and suppressing the secretion of IL-17 and IL-22. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the long-term sustained release of CA-EVs alleviated psoriasis symptoms by controlling the transformation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) subgroups and restoring skin microbiota homeostasis, thus offering a promising therapy for psoriasis treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cutibacterium acnes, which is reduced in psoriasis skin, has been reported to promote skin homeostasis by regulating immune balance. Compared to live bacteria, bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) are less prone to toxicity and safety concerns. bEVs play a pivotal role in maintaining bacterial homeostasis and modulating the immune system. However,bEVs without sustained release materials are unable to function continuously in chronic diseases. Therefore, we utilized hydrogel microspheres to encapsulate Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes)-derived extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs), enabling long term sustained release. Our findings indicate that, CA-EVs loaded gelatin methacrylate hydrogel microspheres (CA-EVs@GHM) showed superior therapeutic effects in treating psoriasis compared to CA-EVs. CA-EVs@GHM exhibited a more significant regulation of pathological type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and skin microbiota, providing a promising approach for microbiota-derived extracellular vesicle therapy in the treatment of skin inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macroscale gradients of brain connectivity have emerged as a central principle for understanding functional brain organization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the principal gradient of functional connectivity in the human brain exists, with unimodal primary sensorimotor regions situated at one end and transmodal regions associated with the default mode network at the other. The functional significance and interpretation of gradients remain a central topic of discussion in the neuroimaging community, with some studies demonstrating that they may be described using meta-analytic functional decoding techniques. However, additional methodological development and tools are necessary to fully leverage available meta-analytic methods to describe connectivity gradients. To this end, we developed Gradec, an open-source Python package for surface-based functional decoding of connectivity gradients. Gradec implements a range of methods for clustering highly connected regions within the principal gradients and meta-analytic decoding on surface space. In addition, it presents a set of visualization functions to facilitate the interpretation of the functional decoding results. Notably, Gradec supports clustering and decoding on a multidimensional space, which helps describe additional components of the gradient decomposition. The current tool aims to provide recommendations on best practices and flexible tools and methods for gradient-based functional decoding of connectivity data.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Macroscale gradients of brain connectivity have emerged as a central principle for understanding functional brain organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The functional significance and interpretation of gradients remain a central topic of discussion in the neuroimaging community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous studies have demonstrated that the gradients may be described using meta-analytic functional decoding techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However, additional methodological development is necessary to fully leverage available meta-analytic methods and resources and quantitatively evaluate their relative performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; investigate and improve the framework of data-driven methods for decoding the principal gradient of functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine and evaluate different methods for decoding brain maps on surface space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish a principled approach for gradient segmentation and meta-analytic decoding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide recommendations on best practices and develop flexible methods for gradient-based functional decoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) group-average dense connectome from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data release to identify the principal gradient of functional connectivity. We evaluated three segmentation approaches: (i) percentile-based, (ii) segmentation based on a 1D k-means clustering approach, and (iii) segmentation based on the Kernel Density Estimation curve of the gradient axis. We assessed six different decoding strategies that used two meta-analytic databases (i.e., Neurosynth and NeuroQuery) and three methods to produce meta-analytic maps (i.e., term-based, LDA-based, and GC-LDA-based decoding). In addition, we proposed a method for decoding lower-order gradient maps combined with the principal gradient in a high-dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For small numbers of segments, a k-means algorithm yields the most confident distribution of boundaries, as shown by the silhouette coefficients, variance ratio, and cluster separation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LDA-based produced meta-analytic maps that yielded a relatively high correlation value and a collection of terms that naturally improved the information content, TFIDF, and SNR.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NS and NQ performed similarly regarding their correlation profile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We reproduced the results from Margulies et al., showing the continuous transition from primary sensorimotor to transmodal regions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We proposed methods for decoding lower-order gradient maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We found that a two-segment solution determined by a k-means segmentation approach and an LDA-based meta-analysis combined with the NeuroQuery database was the optimal combination of methods for decoding the principal gradient of functional connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This combination of approaches and our recommended visualization method for reporting meta-analytic decoding findings will enhance the overall interpretability of macroscale gradients in the fMRI community.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Lonicerin promotes wound healing in diabetic rats by enhancing blood vessel regeneration through Sirt1-mediated autophagy</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the numerous complications of diabetes mellitus, diabetic wounds seriously affect patients’ quality of life and result in considerable psychological distress. Promoting blood vessel regeneration in wounds is a crucial step in wound healing. Lonicerin (LCR), a bioactive compound found in plants of the Lonicera japonica species and other honeysuckle plants, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and it recently has been found to alleviate ulcerative colitis by enhancing autophagy. In this study we investigated the efficacy of LCR in treatment of diabetic wounds and the underlying mechanisms. By comparing the single-cell transcriptomic data from healing and non-healing states in diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) of 5 patients, we found that autophagy and SIRT signaling activation played a crucial role in mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoting cell survival in wound healing processes. In TBHP-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we showed that LCR alleviated cell apoptosis, and enhanced the cell viability, migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that LCR treatment dose-dependently promoted autophagy in TBHP-treated HUVECs by upregulating Sirt1 expression, and exerted its anti-apoptotic effect through the Sirt1-autophagy axis. Knockdown of Sirt1 significantly decreased the level of autophagy, and mitigated the anti-apoptotic effect of LCR. In a STZ-induced diabetic rat model, administration of LCR significantly promoted wound healing, which was significantly attenuated by Sirt1 knockdown. This study highlights the potential of LCR as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetic wounds and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often encounter STEM-associated anxiety, which may hinder their learning, performance, and retention, impacting graduation rates negatively According to attentional control theory (ACT), heightened anxiety redirects the cognitive resources required to perform a task toward processing anxiety-induced stimuli. This diversion could lead to impaired processing efficiency and diminished performance effectiveness.The interaction among the dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and default mode network (DMN) play a pivotal role in attentional control.Our study aimed to expand the ACT framework by exploring the neurobiological correlations between STEM-related anxiety and cognitive performance among 123 undergraduate physics students. We examined the within- and between-network connectivity of the DAN, VAN, and DMN during two in-scanner tasks related to physics cognition, focusing on two subgroups with distinct profiles of science and math anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample included 123 right-handed undergraduate students (mean age=19.8±1.5, range=18-26; 56 females) enrolled in physics courses at Florida International University (FIU), Miami. Self-report instruments assessing science, math, and general anxiety were completed during behavioral sessions. Latent profile analysis (LPA) grouped participants based on science/math anxiety profiles, and regression analysis assessed connectivity differences within/between DAN, VAN, DMN. Participants engaged in two fMRI tasks: The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) task, a self-paced conceptual reasoning task consisting of three phases (Scenario, Question, and Answer), and the Physics Knowledge (PK) task, a general knowledge task of semantic retrieval. Four-week behavioral and imaging sessions were conducted, and anatomical and functional images were preprocessed with fMRIPrep. DAN, VAN, DMN were identified through Kong’s 17-network parcellation [5], yielding 400x400 region-wise correlation matrices per participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LPA results identified two dominant science and math anxiety profiles that accounted for most of the sample: Low Science and Math Anxiety (59.3%) and High Math Anxiety (21.9%) (Fig 3). Less common profiles, High Science and Math Anxiety (6.5%) and High Science Anxiety (4.1%), were not analyzed in this study. No significant differences between High Math Anxiety’ and Low Science and Math Anxiety groups regarding age, sex, ethnicity, income, GPA, FIU enrollment years, general anxiety, FCI/PK tasks accuracy, and Phase II/III FCI task reaction times. However, High Math Anxiety group spent significantly more time on Phase I (Scenario) of the FCI task. In the FCI task, we observed significant variations in between-network connectivity. Specifically, High Math Anxiety participants showed reduced connectivity (DAN-VAN, DAN-DMN, VAN-DMN) exclusively in Phase III (Answer) compared to Low Science and Math Anxiety students. Notably, Phases I (Scenario) and II (Question) revealed no substantial connectivity difference. All phases were unaffected by covariates. During the PK task, High Math Anxiety participants presented significantly reduced DAN-VAN between-network connectivity compared to their Low Science and Math Anxiety counterparts. Covariates did not significantly influence connectivity. The FCI task showed significant alterations in within-network connectivity. High Math Anxiety participants had reduced connectivity (DAN, VAN, DMN) within networks only in Phase III (Answer) compared to Low Science and Math Anxiety participants. No significant difference was noted in within-network connectivity during Phase I (Scenario) and II (Question). Covariates had no impact across all phases. During the PK task, we found significant differences in within-network connectivity. Specifically, High Math Anxiety participants demonstrated a decrease in DAN within-network connectivity compared to Low Science and Math Anxiety participants. No covariate influence on connectivity variation was noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Discussion and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study supports the attentional control theory, demonstrating that High Math Anxiety in students corresponds with reduced task-based connectivity in attention-control-related brain networks during physics conceptual reasoning and knowledge tasks. Future research should investigate how STEM-related anxiety impacts performance across various STEM courses and learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Meta-analytic decoding of the cortical gradient of functional connectivity</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macroscale gradients have emerged as a central principle for understanding functional brain organization. Margulies et al. demonstrated that a principal gradient of connectivity exists, with unimodal, primary sensorimotor regions situated at one end and transmodal regions associated with the default mode network and representative of abstract functioning at the other. The functional interpretation of macroscale gradients remains a central topic of discussion, with some studies demonstrating that gradients may be described using meta-analytic functional decoding. Using the Neurosynth database, meta-analytic decoding of a connectivity gradient has previously been performed by first segmenting the gradient spectrum (i.e., from high- to low-intensity voxels) into five-percentile increments, binarizing the 20 resultant maps, and decoding each map. This segmented approach has been used in prior studies and allows characterization of the full gradient spectrum. However, existing segmentation procedures are arbitrarily determined with equidistant intervals (i.e., five-percentile increments) and could be based on a more data-driven approach. We investigated the performance of various methods to establish a principled approach for gradient segmentation and functional decoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HCP S1200 resting-state fMRI data were used to generate functional connectivity and compute the affinity matrix. Diffusion map embedding was applied to identify the principal gradient of functional connectivity. Whole-brain gradient maps were segmented to divide the gradient spectrum into a finite number of brain maps. Three different segmentation approaches were evaluated: percentile-based (PCT), k-means (KMeans), and KDE. Individual segments were transformed into “activation” brain maps for decoding. The three segmentation approaches were evaluated using the silhouette score. Six different meta-analytic decoding strategies were implemented on surface space, derived from three sets of meta-analytic maps (i.e., term-based (Term), LDA, and GCLDA) and two databases (i.e., NS: Neurosynth and NQ: NeuroQuery). The resultant 18 different decoding strategies were evaluated using four performance metrics, assessed by comparing correlation profiles, semantic similarity metrics (i.e., information content and TFIDF), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, we select the strategy with better performance across metrics for visualization, where the non-functional terms were removed from the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMeans algorithm shows the most consistent result across segment solutions, with a distribution having the highest median value and the lowest number of vertices with negative silhouette coefficients. The KMeans approach consistently resulted in better segment assignment across the cortical surface.Data-driven segmentation determined by a KMeans algorithm produced the most balanced distributions of boundaries with the highest vertex-wise and mean silhouette coefficient across segment solutions. A small number of segments is preferred if we want to produce gradient maps with high silhouette scores, and to find the highest association between the subsegment maps and meta-analytic maps. KMeans provided the best and most consistent segment assignments for the 30 segmentation solutions, with the highest values observed between 3-8 segments. With regard to segmentation approaches, PCT showed the best performance, while KMeans performed better than KDE. LDA-based decoder, in addition to showing a high average of top correlation scores, yielded the highest information content, TFIDF, and SNR, We observed little differences in correlation profile between NS and NQ combinations; in some cases, NS performed slightly better (e.g., Term-PCT), and in others, NQ showed higher correlation values to some degree (e.g., LDA-PCT). The NeuroQuery database showed a higher information content, provided by the richness of its vocabulary as compared to Neurosynth. We propose a figure that delineates the results in a way that most effectively facilitates the interpretation of the functional gradients. The figure captures the continuous transition between different functional systems, from unimodal primary sensorimotor regions associated with “motor” and “movement”, to transmodal regions associated with the default mode network and representative of abstract functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Discussion and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small numbers of segments, a KMeans algorithm yields the most confident distribution of boundaries as shown by the vertex-wise and mean silhouette coefficients. We determined that a large number of segments was detrimental to the performance of correlation decoders, as the average of the top correlation values decreases exponentially with the increase of the segment solution. LDA-based produced meta-analytic maps that yielded both a relatively high correlation value and a collection of terms that naturally improved the information content, TFIDF, and SNR. NS and NQ performed similarly in terms of their correlation profile, given the similarity between their corpora. The size of the vocabulary may help improve the information content of a decoder, as well as the production of more functional terms. As such we recommend using a large database with a large and rich vocabulary like NeuroQuery. In conclusion, we provide recommendations on best practices for gradient-based functional decoding of fMRI data. We found that a K-means segmentation approach and an LDA-based meta-analysis combined with the NeuroQuery database was the optimal combination of methods for decoding functional connectivity gradients.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>N6-methyladenosine RNA Methylation Correlates with Immune Microenvironment and Immunotherapy Response of Melanoma</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/Melanoma"/>
   <updated>2023-02-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/Melanoma</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RNA methylation normally inhibits the self-recognition and immunogenicity of RNA. As such, it is likely an important inhibitor of cancer immune recognition in the tumor microenvironment, but how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affects prognosis and treatment response remains unknown. In eight independent melanoma cohorts (1,564 patients), the modification patterns of 21 m6A gene signatures were systematically correlated with the immune cell infiltration of melanoma tumor microenvironment. m6A modification patterns for each patient were quantified using the principal component analysis method, yielding an m6Ascore that reflects the abundance of m6A RNA modifications. Two different m6A modification patterns were observed in patients with melanoma, separated into high and low m6Ascores that correlated with survival and treatment response. Low m6Ascores were characterized by an immune-inflamed phenotype, with 61.1% 5-year survival. High m6Ascores were characterized by an immune-excluded phenotype, with 52.2% 5-year survival. Importantly, lower m6Ascores correlated with more sensitive anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 treatment responses, with 90% of patients with low m6Ascore responding, whereas 10% of those with high m6Ascore nonresponding (in cohort GSE63557). At single-cell and spatial transcriptome resolution, m6Ascore reflects melanoma malignant progression, immune exhaustion, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Hence, the m6Ascore correlates to an important facet of tumor immune escape as a tool for personalized medicine to guide immunotherapy in patients with melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the development of society and the improvement of life quality, more than 500 million people are affected by diabetes. More than 10 % of people with diabetes will suffer from diabetic wounds, and 80 % of diabetic wounds will reoccur, so the development of new diabetic wound treatments is of great importance. The development of skin microbe research technology has gradually drawn people’s attention to the complex relationship between microbes and diabetic wounds. Many studies have shown that skin microbes are associated with the outcome of diabetic wounds and can even be used as one of the indicators of wound prognosis. Skin microbes have also been found to have the potential to treat diabetic wounds. The wound colonization of different bacteria can exert opposing therapeutic effects. It is necessary to fully understand the skin microbes in diabetic wounds, which can provide valuable guidance for clinical diabetic wound treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Commensal microbiome promotes hair follicle regeneration by inducing keratinocyte HIF-1α signaling and glutamine metabolism</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tissue injury induces metabolic changes in stem cells, which likely modulate regeneration. Using a model of organ regeneration called wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), we identified skin-resident bacteria as key modulators of keratinocyte metabolism, demonstrating a positive correlation between bacterial load, glutamine metabolism, and regeneration. Specifically, through comprehensive multiomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing in murine skin, we show that bacterially induced hypoxia drives increased glutamine metabolism in keratinocytes with attendant enhancement of skin and hair follicle regeneration. In human skin wounds, topical broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibit glutamine production and are partially responsible for reduced healing. These findings reveal a conserved and coherent physiologic context in which bacterially induced metabolic changes improve the tolerance of stem cells to damage and enhance regenerative capacity. This unexpected proregenerative modulation of metabolism by the skin microbiome in both mice and humans suggests important methods for enhancing regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macroscale gradients have emerged as a central principle for understanding functional brain organization. Margulies et al. demonstrated that a principal gradient of connectivity exists, with unimodal, primary sensorimotor regions situated at one end and transmodal regions associated with the default mode network and representative of abstract functioning at the other. The functional interpretation of macroscale gradients remains a central topic of discussion, with some studies demonstrating that gradients may be described using meta-analytic functional decoding. Using the Neurosynth database, meta-analytic decoding of a connectivity gradient has previously been performed by first segmenting the gradient spectrum (i.e., from high- to low-intensity voxels) into five-percentile increments, binarizing the 20 resultant maps, and decoding each map. This segmented approach has been used in prior studies and allows characterization of the full gradient spectrum; however, existing segmentation procedures are arbitrarily determined with equidistant intervals (i.e., five-percentile increments) and should be based on a more data-driven approach. We investigated the performance of various methods to establish a principled approach for gradient segmentation and functional decoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, we utilized the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) group-average dense connectome from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data release to identify the principal gradient of functional connectivity. Following Margulies et al., an inverse Fisher transform was applied to the z-transformed correlation from the dense connectome to scale the values between -1 and 1; connections that included vertex in the medial wall were zeroed. Diffusion embedding was applied to the cosine similarity affinity matrix using the mapalign repository. We utilized the gradient (i.e., eigenvector) with the highest variance explained (i.e., eigenvalue), also called the principal gradient, for further analysis. We evaluated three segmentation approaches: (i) percentile-based, equidistant segmentation, (ii) segmentation based on a 1D k-means clustering approach, and (iii) segmentation based on the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) curve of the gradient axis (Figure 1). n=30 different segmentations of the principal gradient for each segmentation approach were generated, corresponding to numbers of segments ranging from k=3-32 . Mean silhouette scores were computed to determine relative performance across percentile-based, k-means-based, and KDE-based segmentations, with the highest mean silhouette score representing the “best” relative performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observed that a data-driven segmentation approach (e.g., KMeans-based) is preferable to an equidistant segmentation (Figure 2). In particular, the k-means clustering approach showed the “best” relative performance across segment sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued work on this project will include assessment of six decoding strategies using two meta-analytic databases and three sets of meta-analytic maps. An optimization test will be performed to identify the segmentation that yielded a maximum association between meta-analytic maps and gradient maps for each of the six decoding strategies. Data are available on G-Node GIN and version controlled with DataLad; all code required to reproduce the analyses and figures in this paper is made available on GitHub. The decoding workflow is being made available for future re-use and be linked to NiMARE as a Python module for gradient meta-analytic decoding. Taken together, the current work aims to provide recommendations on best practices, along with open-source tools and flexible methods, for gradient-based functional decoding of fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;highlights&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Orphan GPCRs Mrgpra2a/b are defensin receptors in neutrophils
•	Defensin-Mrgpra2 signaling preserves skin microbiome diversity
•	Deletion of defensins or Mrgpra2 impairs neutrophil-mediated bacterial clearance
•	Activation of Mrgpra2 by defensins triggers neutrophils to release IL-1β and CXCL2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy skin maintains a diverse microbiome and a potent immune system to fight off infections. Here, we discovered that the epithelial-cell-derived antimicrobial peptides defensins activated orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) Mrgpra2a/b on neutrophils. This signaling axis was required for effective neutrophil-mediated skin immunity and microbiome homeostasis. We generated mutant mouse lines lacking the entire Defensin (Def) gene cluster in keratinocytes or Mrgpra2a/b. Def and Mrgpra2 mutant animals both exhibited skin dysbiosis, with reduced microbial diversity and expansion of Staphylococcus species. Defensins and Mrgpra2 were critical for combating S. aureus infections and the formation of neutrophil abscesses, a hallmark of antibacterial immunity. Activation of Mrgpra2 by defensin triggered neutrophil release of IL-1β and CXCL2 which are vital for proper amplification and propagation of the antibacterial immune response. This study demonstrated the importance of epithelial-neutrophil signaling via the defensin-Mrgpra2 axis in maintaining healthy skin ecology and promoting antibacterial host defense.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>IOBR: Multi-Omics Immuno-Oncology Biological Research to Decode Tumor Microenvironment and Signatures</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/IOBR"/>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have triggered the rapid accumulation of publicly available multi-omics datasets. The application of integrated omics to explore robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly emphasized, and this is attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockades in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools for comprehensively interpreting multi-omics data are still warranted to provide increased granularity into the intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Therefore, we developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing a comprehensive investigation of the estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution, and signature construction based on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling, genomic characteristics, and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection. Collectively, IOBR is a user-friendly tool for leveraging multi-omics data to facilitate immuno-oncology exploration and to unveil tumor-immune interactions and accelerating precision immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;As part of the OHBM 2021 Symposium, “Addressing the Social Limitations in Open Science”, Dr. Bottenhorn gave this presentation virtually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of open science are, broadly, to democratize access and to promote good research practices.
Unfortunately, these goals fall short in several key ways, at the center of which are equity, diversity, and
inclusivity (EDI) not only of the community, but of the fruits of their labors. Historically, the open science
movement has been dominated by a narrow demographic with the access and support (institutional and
otherwise) to time and resources they can spend on “open science” efforts. This monolithic culture has
been furthered by (1) a gravitation of open science efforts on technical solutions and valuation of
technical skills and (2) a reliance on computational resources that are inaccessible to a large proportion
of the globe. While the community has become more diverse in the past few years, there is still a long
way to go and the products of open science remain sequestered in the global North. Furthermore, EDI
disparities have been highlighted by continuing socio-economic issues, recent increases in related
scholarship, and the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing that our science isn’t as open as it should be. From
culture to reachability, accessibility, there remains a lot of room for improvement. Failure in achieving EDI
goals, not only hinders science, but imposes clear limitations and biases in the voices around us and the
knowledge we produce. Science benefits from diversity in perspectives, experiences, and beliefs, in
addition to accessible tools and reproducible research practices. New ways of thinking, understanding
and learning are needed, new ways of establishing inclusion as a culture is needed to encourage and
include historically underrepresented people, without such practices open science would not be as open
as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of emergency savings during uncertain times particularly among populations impacted by adverse social determinants of health (SDoH)[1]. SDoH, such as low socioeconomic status (low-SES), have been linked with a range of cognitive operations including working memory (WM), and have shown to impact health and education outcomes, rendering individuals vulnerable to disparities[2,3]. Despite evidence suggesting that financial stability may minimize SDoH related disparities[4,5], neurocognitive mechanisms associated with money-saving behavior among individuals impacted by adverse SDoH remains to be understood. To this end, we interrogated brain activity supporting WM performance, a cognitive construct widely impacted by low-SES related stress, to identify potential neurocognitive markers associated with saving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We employed a widely utilized WM paradigm (N-back task) and collected fMRI data from individuals (n=24, 14 females; age: 24-60 years) with low-SES (income&amp;lt;$20,000/yr). Participants also completed a self-report measure of cognitive failures and a financial program where their money saving behavior was tracked over a 6-month period. Following preprocessing utilizing fMRIprep[6], fMRI task regressors along with nuisance regressors were entered in a subject-level general linear model to obtain task-evoked activation maps associated with three different WM loads (i.e., 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back versus vigilant 0-back)[7]. Significant brain activity related to each WM load was identified utilizing a whole brain, one-sample t-test (3dTtest++: two-tailed, pvoxel-wise=0.001, cluster extent: 26 voxels). To assess brain-behavior relationships, we assessed Pearson’s correlations between beta-coefficients extracted from identified clusters and measures of WM task performance (d-prime), self-reported cognitive failures, and real-world saving behavior. We further conducted a mediation analysis to probe if task performance (M) mediated the effect of WM-related brain activity (X) on money savings (Y)[8].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding task-effects, we observed WM-load related deactivations in brain regions associated with the default mode network (DMN) (i.e., precuneus and medial frontal gyrus [MFG]). Further, we observed that DMN deactivation was negatively correlated with task performance such that increased WM-related deactivations were linked with improved task performance [precuneus: r(24)=-0.43, p=0.03, MFG: r(24)=-0.43, p=0.02] [Fig.1]. As WM task performance correlated with both task-based regional deactivations and saving behavior [savings-task performance: r(24)=0.56, p=0.005], we subsequently conducted a mediation analysis to test if the influence of DMN deactivation (X) on savings behavior (Y) was mediated by task performance (M). We found that task performance fully mediated the influence of DMN deactivation on savings behavior. Specifically, when including WM task performance as a mediator, DMN’s direct effect on savings failed to reach significance, whereas the indirect effect was significant (Precuneus; ab path: β = -103.96: 96% CI= -221.22, -23.06, MFG; ab path: β = -145.61: 95% CI = -420.35, -2.16) [Fig.2]. These results indicate that increased WM-related DMN deactivation predicted improved task performance and, improved task performance, in turn, predicted better saving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings indicate that individual differences in WM performance and/or WM-related DMN deactivation may be relevant aspects associated with successful money saving behavior. Understanding underlying brain-behavior relationships associated with savings behavior among low-SES individuals may provide principled first steps toward the development of tailored interventions aiming to increase financial stability and facilitate adaptive behavioral change for financial success aimed towards minimizing SDoH related disparity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To alleviate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea, loss of appetite) people living with HIV (PLWH) often report using cannabis (CB). Of the 38 million PLWH, nearly half demonstrate neurocognitive impairments highlighting a need to clarify the brain-based manifestations of such impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that HIV infection and chronic CB use are both separately linked with alterations in default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity. Prior studies have also demonstrated that resting-state connectivity networks correlate with underlying structural connections between functional nodes. Elucidating the relationship between CB use, HIV infection, and DMN structural connectivity is important for improved understanding of the impact of these conditions on neurocognitive functions, and to better inform patients, healthcare providers, and policy makers about medicinal and/or recreational CB use among PLWH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data, we characterized the structural connectivity profiles of DMN regions among 100 participants stratified into four groups based on HIV serostatus and CB use history (HIV+/CB+, n=27; HIV+/CB-, n=24; HIV-/CB+, n=27; HIV-/CB-, n=22). To establish the structural connectivity profiles across DMN nodes a deterministic fiber tractography algorithm (FA threshold = 0.20, angle threshold = 30°, min length = 30 mm, max length = 500mm, seed count = 100,000) was used to track bilateral cingulum tracts (CT), the bilateral superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (FOF), and the genu of the corpus callosum (CC). Participants completed a battery of well-validated tasks to quantify behavioral measures of inhibitory control, error processing, and general cognitive control. To explore the influence of HIV and CB on structural connectivity, first a 2x2 ANOVA, including age and sex as covariates was conducted on individual white matter tract DVs. Then, for the tracts showing group-level differences, a mixed linear regression was conducted with an emphasis on the HIVxCB interaction when considering DTI metrics and behavioral measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANOVA analysis of white matter tracts identified significant group differences in tract number for the right CT between HIV groups (Fig. 1A), tract volume of the left CT between CB groups (Fig. 1B), and the FA values of the right superior FOF between CB groups (Fig. 1C). Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that HIV+ (vs. HIV-) groups had more right cingulum tracts, and CB+ (vs. CB-) groups had greater tract volume in the left cingulum and higher FA in the right superior FOF. The linear regression analyses on the left CT, right superior FOF, and right CT identified a significant interaction between CB and FA in the left cingulum, such that CB+ groups demonstrated more preservative errors than the CB- groups (Fig. 2A). Across all participants, left cingulum tract volume was positively associated with general processing speed (Fig. 2B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left cingulum tract connects the posterior cingulate cortex, (para)hippocampal regions, entorhinal cortex, and the medial temporal lobes, which are areas commonly linked with both memory and emotional regulation. Our results suggest that the left cingulum tract may be more susceptible to CB-related structural connectivity alterations regardless of HIV serostatus. These results also suggest that DMN structural connectivity alterations may contribute to more preservative errors reflecting reduced cognitive flexibility (shifting). Taken together, these outcomes provide enhanced insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of HIV and CB-related impacts on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain function supporting error-monitoring has rarely been examined among persons living with HIV (PLWH) despite its importance for recognizing and preventing maladaptive behavior (e.g., medication non-adherence) that could lead to worsened health outcomes among this vulnerable population. As medicinal and recreational cannabis use is prevalent among PLWH [1], we aimed to assess interactive impacts of HIV infection and chronic cannabis (CB) use on error-processing brain activity and investigate implications for clinically relevant disease management behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sample of 103 participants (68.0% male, mean age=35.610.9 years) was stratified into four groups based on HIV serostatus and CB use history (HIV+/CB+, n=30; HIV+/CB-, n=25; HIV-/CB+, n=26; HIV-/CB-, n=22). To probe error-processing mechanisms, participants underwent fMRI scanning while completing a Go/NoGo, motor inhibition paradigm called the Error Awareness Task (EAT). Participants also completed a battery of well-validated instruments including the Revised Medication Management Test (MMT-R), an objective behavioral measure of medication management abilities [2], and self-reports of cannabis use history. Following preprocessing (FMRIPREP v1.1.1 [3]), six EAT runs were entered into a subject-level general linear model (GLM) including nuisance regressors and three task-related regressors. To characterize brain activity linked with cognitive control/failures, NoGo-correct minus NoGo-error [C-E] contrast values were assessed with a whole-brain, one-sample t-test (3dTtest++: two-tailed, pvoxel-wise=1.0e-10, cluster extent: 20 voxels). To assess HIV and CB main and interaction effects on these [C-E] contrast values, a whole-brain, 2(HIV) x 2(CB) ANOVA (3dMVM), including sex, age, and IQ as covariates, was performed. To assess brain-behavior relationships, we conducted Pearson’s correlations between averaged error-related  coefficients, extracted from identified clusters/regions of interest (ROIs), and error frequency in the EAT (ERROR COUNT). To probe clinically-relevant implications of HIV-associated alterations, we examined relationships between error-related brain activity and behavioral performance on the MMT-R (MMT SCORE) by conducting HIV-status x MMT SCORE ANCOVAs. Additionally, we tested a meditation model in which error-related brain activity (M) mediated the effect of HIV-status (X) on MMT SCORE (Y) [4, 5]. Finally, to evaluate the impact of lifetime cannabis use amount (AMOUNT), we assessed HIV-status x AMOUNT interactions on error-related brain activity and MMT SCORE among cannabis using participants (n=55).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observed error-related brain activity in the anterior insula that was associated with better EAT performance across the full sample. Regarding group effects, PLWH displayed a lack of error-related deactivation in two default mode network (DMN) hub regions (the posterior cingulate cortex [PCC] and medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) that was contrarily observed among HIV- controls (Fig.1A). Additionally, degree of PCC suppression was associated with improved EAT performance among HIV- controls but not among PLWH (Fig.1B). CB main and interaction effects were not detected. Across all groups, reduced error-related PCC deactivation was associated with poorer medication management performance (Fig.2A) and mediated the effect of HIV-status on medication management abilities (Fig.2B). Finally, amount of CB used over the lifetime was associated with reduced mPFC deactivation to errors among CB using, HIV- controls, and poorer medication management abilities across all CB users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate diminished error-related DMN suppression among PLWH linked to poor medication management. Identifying this HIV-associated, neurobiological alteration, which may contribute to high rates of medication nonadherence among this population [6, 7], could inform treatment planning and tailor self-care education.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Denoising physiological data collected during multi-band, multi-echo EPI sequences</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bottenhorn-physio-ohbm"/>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utility of physiological data collected during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is twofold, both in removing non-neural physiological noise from fMRI data and in studying psychophysiological phenomena. However, MR sequences impart significant artifacts on simultaneously-collected physiological data, obscuring phenomena of interest and necessitating effective data cleaning approaches. While single-echo (SE) MRI sequences that measure the blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal are the norm in fMRI research, advances in MR technology and denoising are prompting researchers to turn to multi-echo (ME) sequences, offering better differentiation between BOLD signal and non-neural noise for improved estimates of brain activation.1-3 Despite their benefits, ME sequences limit temporal resolution, as adding echoes extends repetition times (TRs), and introduce added artifacts to concurrent physiological data. The former can be mitigated by using multi-band (MB) excitation, reducing the time required to acquire a single volume by acquiring several slices simultaneously. The latter complicates the use of physiological data in fMRI studies using ME sequences, which we address here by comparing strategies for MR-artifact removal in physiological data across SE and ME BOLD fMRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physiological data were collected at 2000Hz using MRI-compatible equipment from BIOPAC Systems. Data were acquired using a BIOPAC MP150 system with MRI-RFIF filters: electrocardiogram (ECG) data with a 3-lead bipolar configuration and an ECG100C-MRI amplifier; electrodermal activity (EDA) recordings, from the nondominant hand, with an EDA100C-MRI amplifier.
Physiological data were acquired in the bore of a 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma during both a MBSE BOLD echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence and a MBME BOLD EPI sequence.
The MBSE sequence is by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study,4 which acquires 60 slices with TE=30ms, TR=800ms, and MB factor of 6.
The MBME sequence is from the distribution of MB GRE-EPI sequences developed by the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota, and acquires 48 slices in 4 echoes (TE1=11.80ms, TE2=28.04ms, TE3=44.28ms, TE4=60.52ms), TR=1500ms, MB factor of 3.5
Code used to create and apply these filters is available on GitHub (github.com/62442katieb/mbme-physio-denoising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Fourier transforms of ECG and EDA data before and during both sequences, we identified MR-related noise in frequencies corresponding to the TR and slice acquisition. The effects of this noise were greater during ME than SE sequences, which is visually apparent in (1) the difference between recordings collected before and during the two BOLD EPI sequences and (2) their frequency spectra (MBSE-ECG in Fig. 1A-B vs. 1C-D; MBME-ECG in Fig. 1I-J vs. 1K-L and MBSE-ECG in Fig. 2A-B vs. 2C-D; MBME-ECG in Fig. 2I-J vs. 2K-L). By adapting recommendations from industry leaders and prior research, we developed and applied digital infinite impulse-response (IIR) notch filters, greatly reducing the impact of this noise on physiological data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MB and ME pulse sequences introduce more complicated artifacts concurrent physiological data than can be addressed with current industry recommendations. Our research finds that these artifacts are predictable and their effects can be greatly mitigated with notch filters centered at their fundamental frequencies and harmonics. By targeting the slice acquisition frequency, adjusted for MB factor, and TR frequency, especially with ME sequences, researchers should be able to remove significant MR-related artifacts from ECG and EDA data collected during fMRI scans using straightforward digital filters. Such recommendations allow researchers to capitalize on the improved SNR afforded by MBSE and MBME BOLD sequences, while including rich physiological data for both cleaning fMRI data and investigating psychophysiological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>IDConn: A Python pipeline for investigating individual differences in functional brain connectivity</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bottenhorn-idconn-ohbm"/>
   <updated>2021-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shown variability in brain network organization within individuals is nearly as great as variability within a group. [1] This has implications for human neuroimaging research and illustrates the need for a greater understanding of sources of individual variability in brain network organization and how it relates to behavior. Here, we present an open-source pipeline for assessing Individual Differences in the brain’s functional Connectivity (IDConn). IDConn is a data analysis workflow that combines methods for assessing individual differences from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with connectomics, network science, and robust statistical methods, adjusted to address the unique challenges of fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDConn (github.com/NBCLab/IDConn) brings together existing tools to create a configurable pipeline that is accessible to researchers, regardless of their technical background. It integrates functions from Nilearn [2], Nipype [3], scikit-learn [4], SciPy [5], Numpy[6], NiBabel, Pandas, Seaborn, statsmodels, NetworkX, and the Brain Connectivity Toolbox [7] in Python to provide the following workflow (Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computation of brain connectivity graphs (including input/output support)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computation of topological and graph theoretic measures from these graphs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data organization, harmonization, and treatment of missing data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Statistical analysis, including multivariate regressions and robust corrections for multiple comparisons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generation of publication-quality figures based on these analyses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDConn was designed for applications in human neuroimaging research, providing a flexible, open data analysis stream that takes in preprocessed fMRI data and provides computed graphs, derived graph measures, statistical models and the results thereof, and, optionally, figures presenting these results, all in an organized, sharing-friendly format for optimal reproducibility and transparency. It has already been used in two scientific publications. Gonzalez and Bottenhorn et al. [8] used an early iteration of IDConn to assess how differences in resting state functional connectivity between canonical brain networks are related to generalized anxiety and anxiety around Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (i.e., STEM anxiety) and how these relations may differ between male and female university students before and after their first physics class (Fig. 2, top). Bottenhorn et al. [9] used IDConn to assess how task-based functional network organization supports relations between intelligence and academic achievement during physics-related cognition (Fig. 2, bottom). Bringing together robust tools for fMRI data processing and statistical inference, IDConn enables statistically-robust assessments of individual differences in functional brain connectivity and organization by neuroimaging researchers, Python-naïve to seasoned Pythonistas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDConn is a configurable data analysis pipeline for assessing individual differences in functional connectivity and derived network measures. It amalgamates existing tools for neuroimaging data analysis, data science, machine learning, graph theoretic network analysis, statistics, and scientific computing into a unified, streamlined workflow for sophisticated, rigorous computation and extraction of connectivity and graph theoretic measures, for analyses with behavioral, demographic, psychophysiological, or other continuous variables. Furthermore, it conforms with the Brain Imaging Data Structure [10] for optimal redistribution and sharing of pipeline outputs. While there are a host of extant open-source software tools for analyzing fMRI data, many assume a level of code literacy and related skills that are not as common among researchers from the psychological sciences. IDConn fills this gap and provides an open, reproducible option for data analysis that incorporates high-quality software tools and up-to-date “best practices’’ for analyzing fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors that enhance regeneration are largely unknown. The immune system and microbiome are attributed roles in repairing and regenerating structure but their precise interplay is unclear. Here, we assessed the function of skin bacteria in wound healing and wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), a rare adult organogenesis model. WIHN levels and stem cell markers correlate with bacterial counts, being lowest in germ-free (GF), intermediate in conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF), and highest in wild-type mice, even those infected with pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Reducing skin microbiota via cage changes or topical antibiotics decreased WIHN. Inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and keratinocyte-dependent IL-1R-MyD88 signaling are necessary and sufficient for bacteria to promote regeneration. Finally, in a small trial, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic also slowed skin wound healing in adult volunteers. These results demonstrate a role for IL-1β to control morphogenesis and support the need to reconsider routine applications of topical prophylactic antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Association of the Psoriatic Microenvironment With Treatment Response</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/PSO-Enviroment"/>
   <updated>2020-09-02T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/papers/PSO-Enviroment</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importance
The ability to predict the efficacy of systemic psoriasis therapy based on immune profiles in skin biopsies could reduce the use of inappropriate treatment and its associated costs and adverse events. It could considerably decrease drug development trial costs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective
To develop a bioinformatic gene signature score derived from skin mRNA to predict psoriasis treatment outcomes for a variety of therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants
In this decision analytical model using 1145 skin samples from different cohorts of 12 retrospective psoriasis studies, samples were analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm to define the immune landscape of psoriasis lesions and controls. Random forest classification and principal component analysis algorithms were used to estimate psoriatic microenvironment (PME) signature genes and construct a PME score. Overall, 85 and 421 psoriasis lesions from 1 and 4 independent cohorts were used as discovery and validation studies, respectively. Among them, 157, 71, 89, and 90 psoriasis lesions were treated with etanercept, tofacitinib, adalimumab, and methotrexate, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures
Number of weeks after treatment initiation when responders and nonresponders could be predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results
Overall, 22 immune cell subtypes formed infiltration patterns that differentiated psoriasis lesions from healthy skin. In psoriasis lesions, the expression of 33 PME signature genes defined 2 immune phenotypes and in aggregate could be simplified to a numerical PME score. A high PME score, characterized by keratinocyte differentiation, correlated with a better treatment response (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] reduction, 75.8%; 95% CI, 69.4% to 82.2%; P = .03), whereas a low PME score exhibited an immune activation signature and was associated with a worse response (PASI reduction, 53.5%; 95% CI, 45.3% to 61.7%; P = .03). The PME score at week 4 after treatment initiation correlated with future responder vs nonresponder to treatment status 8 to 12 weeks earlier than PASI reduction for etanercept, methotrexate plus adalimumab, and tofacitinib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Relevance
The PME score is a biometric score that may predict clinical efficacy of systemic psoriasis therapy in advance of clinical responses. As an application of personalized medicine, it may reduce the exposure of patients with psoriasis to ineffective and expensive therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NiMARE: A Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-ohbm2"/>
   <updated>2020-06-25T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-ohbm2</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta-analytic databases like BrainMap, Neurosynth, and NeuroVault have become extremely popular tools for a range of analyses, including coordinate- and image-based meta-analysis, region-of-interest definition, meta-analytic coactivation modeling, meta-analytic parcellation, semantic model development, and quantitative functional decoding. Each of these analyses has been approached in a number of ways across the literature, often accompanied with closed-source code, or even no code at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NiMARE (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment) is a Python library that implements a range of meta-analytic tools for neuroimaging data. NiMARE is open source, collaboratively developed, and includes citations for all methods so that the original creators will receive credit in any publications using their method. NiMARE is currently in alpha development, although in the past year the package has developed considerably. Here we describe the latest improvements to NiMARE, including documentation, implemented methods, software improvements, and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NiMARE’s principal purpose is to consolidate meta-analytic algorithms designed for neuroimaging data into a single, open source package with a common interface across methods, much like scikit-learn has done for classification algorithms. NiMARE relies on a highly modularized coding style, in which each kind of algorithm is grouped with similar algorithms, regardless of source. This style is enhanced with an object-oriented approach, in which modules share parent classes so that each algorithm shares the same inputs, methods, and outputs with others of the same type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, NiMARE implements a number of meta-analytic algorithms and associated analytic tools. Meta-analytic algorithms are split into image- and coordinate-based methods. NiMARE includes a range of coordinate-based meta-analysis algorithms, including activation likelihood estimation, specific coactivation likelihood estimation, multilevel kernel density analysis, and kernel density analysis. For image-based meta-analyses, NiMARE implements a number of common fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects methods, and has recently added Bayesian mixed-effects methods with the Stan package. The general nature of many of these image-based methods has led the NiMARE developers to create a separate, domain-agnostic meta-analysis library, PyMARE (https://github.com/neurostuff/PyMARE), from which NiMARE can import methods and vectorize them across voxels in order to apply them to fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to meta-analyses, NiMARE has added methods for automated annotation, functional decoding, and dataset extraction. In the past year, NiMARE has added support for generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation and standard latent Dirichlet allocation, as well as annotation methods using the Cognitive Atlas ontology. Associated functional decoding and encoding methods are supported as well. NiMARE has also added a number of dataset extraction methods to allow users to easily access a number of resources that can be used in conjunction with the algorithms implemented in the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NiMARE aims to centralize neuroimaging meta-analysis methods, with contributions from both developers and users. In the past year, we have hosted a hackathon with over a dozen attendees, added support for new annotation, decoding, and extraction methods, and expanded testing and documentation. Additionally, NiMARE has been used in a number of posters, as well as the recent preprint for the NARPS project [Botvinik-Nezer et al. 2019].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is prevalent among individuals living with HIV for medicinal purposes, including pain management.
The insular cortex plays a critical role in interoceptive function and the sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational aspects of pain.
Whereas insular-cortical alterations have been independently linked with CB use and HIV infection in neurocircuits associated with higher-level cognitive functions, the combined impact of CB and HIV in resting-state functional connectivity remains to be clarified.
Study purpose: [1] Characterize alterations in insular connectivity linked to HIV
infection and further exasperated by chronic cannabis use.
[2] Explore associations between this aberrant connectivity and psychological constructs using meta-analytic functional decoding methods.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Intelligence and academic performance: Is it all in your head?</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom and ample educational literature suggest that intelligence is related to academic performance. While the search for the underlying biology of intelligence predates modern neuroscience, the neural architecture of intelligence remains largely unknown. Mounting evidence suggests it may be related to connectivity in and efficiency of functional brain networks, which differs between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we take a targeted approach to assess what roles, if any, intelligence may play in academic performance. By studying university students enrolled in an introductory physics course, we assessed how intelligence predicts both course performance and physics-related cognition, and how it is supported by individual differences in functional brain networks during physics-related cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim: Neuroimaging studies have provided insight into the structural and functional brain alterations linked with substance abuse; yet, these studies often assess such alterations within the context of individual drugs (e.g., nicotine). Rather, neurobiological theories of addiction emphasize common network-level brain alterations across drug classes. Using emergent meta-analytic neuroimaging techniques, we sought to identify common structural brain alterations across drugs and to characterize the functionally-connected networks with which such structurally-altered regions interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a literature search and identified 87 studies characterizing gray matter volume (GMV) differences between substance users versus non-users. Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm we identified convergent GMV reductions across all studies. Next, we characterized an “extended addiction network” (eAN) by identifying the brain areas that were functionally-coupled with these structurally-altered regions. To do so, we performed resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and meta-analytic connectivity (maC) analyses using each structurally-altered region as a seed and computed whole-brain functional connectivity profiles as the union of both rsFC and maC maps. We considered regions to constitute nodes in the eAN where at least 3 of the functional connectivity profiles overlapped. Finally, we performed hierarchical clustering with all of the eAN node’s functional connectivity profiles to identify sub-networks linked with substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified the left insula, cingulate, and medial/superior frontal gyri as regions showing convergent GMV reductions among users. The overlap of these region’s functional connectivity profiles identified the cingulate, bilateral insulae, putamen, and superior temporal gyrus as regions of the eAN. Hierarchical clustering identified 3 sub-networks closely corresponding to the default-mode (posterior-cingulate, angular gyrus), salience (dorsal anterior cingulate, caudate), and executive control networks (lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These outcomes indicate that structurally-altered brain regions linked with substance abuse are functionally connected to canonical intrinsic connectivity networks (default-mode, salience, and executive control).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Peer influences on adolescents’ intentions for future electronic nicotine delivery system use</title>

&lt;p&gt;Jessica gave this 10 minute pre-recorded talk for the virtual CPDD conference in June, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim: Electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) use among teens has skyrocketed. Evidence suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents’ use propensity. A more precise understanding of how peers impact future ENDS use intentions could identify potential intervention and/or prevention targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: We assessed psychosocial variables mediating the relationship between peer ENDS use and future use intentions at wave 1 of a longitudinal study among a sample (N=248) of high-school students (14-17 years old, M=14.950.67, Hispanic/Latinx: 84.7%). Participants completed items from the Monitoring the Future survey to assess perceived peer use, items from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) survey to assess their own use intentions, the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale, and the E-cigarette Attitudes Survey. We estimated a serial multiple mediator model to investigate direct and indirect effects of perceived peer use on intentions to use (one year from now). Specifically, we expected that peer ENDS use would impact resistance to peer influence, which in turn would impact positive ENDS attitudes, and ultimately influence ENDS use intentions. Bootstrapping procedures were used to estimate the statistical significance of indirect effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Findings indicate a negative association between peer ENDS use and resistance to peer influence (β=-0.20, p=0.001), a negative association between resistance to peer influence and ENDS attitudes (β=-0.18, p=0.003), and a positive association between ENDS attitudes and use intentions (β=2.78, p&amp;lt;0.001). Both the direct (β=0.15, p&amp;lt;0.001) and indirect (β=0.010; 95%CI=[0.002, 0.024]) effects were significant indicating the association between peer use and future ENDS use intentions was partially mediated by resistance to peer influence via ENDS attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These outcomes suggest that social influences can impact teens’ future ENDS use intentions by modulating ENDS attitudes. Interventions facilitating resistance to peer influence among teens with ENDS using peers may be a viable prevention target.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team/tobia-michael&quot;&gt;Dr. Michael Tobia&lt;/a&gt; (Principal Investigator), &lt;a href=&quot;/team/sutherland-matthew&quot;&gt;Dr. Matthew Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; (Mentor), and &lt;a href=&quot;/team/laird-angela&quot;&gt;Dr. Angela Laird&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Investigator) were awarded funding from The Research Center in Minority Institutions at Florida International University to investigate health disparities among aging individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias among racial/ethnic minority groups represents a national health disparity, which is particularly relevant to the population of South Florida. Olfactory loss, defined as reduced sensory acuity and cognitive functioning involving the sense of smell, is a well-established prodromal biomarker of cognitive impairment associated with AD and other dementias. Research has shown there is a significant racial/ethnic disparity in olfactory ability such that the age of onset and rate of decline among Hispanics and African Americans parallels the disparity with respect to AD prevalence. A brain-based assessment that probes the integrity of olfactory-related brain regions and brain networks may provide prognostic insight into olfactory dysfunction or disease trajectory which pre-dates the onset of overt sensory and/or neurocognitive impairments, and would allow for early/preventive health programs to intervene more successfully. This pilot project represents the first step in a research program aiming to discover the impact of health disparity on brain function, with the ultimate goal of identifying prognostic brain-based biomarkers for AD and dementia among the racially and ethnically diverse aging population residing in the South Florida region.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interactive effects of chronic cannabis use and HIV infection on striatal-cortical functional connectivity</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/flannery-hivcb-ohbm"/>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both medical and recreational cannabis use are prevalent among individuals living with HIV (1). Given that functional alterations in striatal-cortical circuitry have been separately linked with both HIV infection (2) and chronic cannabis use (3, 4), and that such neurocircuitry is implicated in decision-making, action selection and impulsivity (5-7), we examined the interactive effects of chronic cannabis (CB) use and HIV infection on striatal-centric resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assessed resting-state fMRI data (8-min) from 94 individuals stratified by HIV-serostatus and history of chronic cannabis use (30 HIV+/CB+; 24 HIV+/CB-; 21 HIV-/CB+; 19 HIV-/CB-). Following preprocessing, we generated whole-brain connectivity maps for Harvard-Oxford atlas-defined bilateral nucleus accumbens (NA) and caudate seed regions of interest (ROIs). To assess group differences in striatal rsFC, we conducted 2(HIV+ vs. HIV-) x 2(CB+ vs. CB-) ANCOVAs (controlling for age) utilizing AFNI’s 3dMVM program (threshold: p-voxel&amp;lt;0.001; p-cluster: p&amp;lt;0.01). To characterize the nature of significant group-level effects, we plotted mean connectivity beta-values by group for each significant region identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all participants, average whole-brain NA and caudate rsFC maps were largely consistent with previous investigations of striatal functional coupling (8, 9). Regarding group effects, while NA rsFC did not display any main or interaction effects, HIVxCB interactions were detected for both the left and right caudate seeds with the left premotor cortex, right lingual/fusiform gyrus, and bilateral precuneus (Fig. 1A &amp;amp; 2A). Specifically, among HIV+ individuals, chronic cannabis users (vs. nonusers) displayed less caudate-cortical rsFC, whereas among HIV- individuals, chronic cannabis users displayed greater caudate-cortical connectivity (Fig. 1B &amp;amp; 2B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the interpretation of these whole-brain outcomes, we explored the relations between caudate-centric rsFC and aspects of self-reported impulsivity. Given the caudate has previously been implicated in impulsivity and goal-oriented motor responses (5-7), we performed ancillary bivariate correlations between Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) first-order factor scores (10) and the caudate’s rsFC with those regions identified above (Bonferroni-corrected for 6 BIS factors). Among HIV+ individuals, but not HIV- individuals, both left and right caudate rsFC with the left premotor cortex and left precuneus were significantly, positively correlated with motor impulsivity scores (Fig. 1C &amp;amp; 2C). Left and right caudate rsFC with the right precuneus and right lingual/fusiform gyrus were also positively correlated with motor impulsivity, however these correlations did not survive multiple comparisons correction. Self-control impulsivity scores were also significantly, positively correlated with the left caudate’s rsFC with the left premotor area and the right caudate’s rsFC with the left precuneus (Fig. 1D &amp;amp; 2D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that chronic cannabis use has differential effects on striatal-cortical functional connectivity among HIV+ versus HIV- individuals. While further research exploring the cognitive-behavioral implications of these functional alterations is warranted, our exploratory correlation analyses suggest that individual differences in caudate-cortical functional coupling, among individuals living with HIV, may be associated with aspects of impulsivity. These findings support an existing body of literature implicating functional interactions between the striatum and higher-order cortical association regions with impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NiMARE: A Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-ohbm"/>
   <updated>2019-06-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-ohbm</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present NiMARE, a Python package for performing meta-analyses of the neuroimaging literature. While extant meta-analytic packages implement one or two algorithms each, NiMARE provides a standard syntax for performing a wide range of analyses and for interacting with databases of coordinates and images from fMRI studies (e.g., brainspell, Neurosynth, and Neurovault). NiMARE joins a growing Python ecosystem for neuroimaging research, which includes tools like nipype, nistats, and nilearn. As with these other tools, NiMARE is open source, collaboratively developed, and built with ease of use in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a demonstration of NiMARE’s capabilities, we have performed a series of meta-analyses of a set of 21 fMRI studies of pain taken from Neurovault. NiMARE contains implementations of the nine image-based meta-analytic (IBMA) methods described in Maumet and Nichols (2016; MFX GLM, RFX GLM, FFX GLM, Contrast Permutation, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, Weighted Stouffer’s, Z MFX, and Z Permutation), as well as five coordinate-based meta-analytic (CBMA) methods (ALE, SCALE, MKDA density, MKDA chi-square, and KDA density).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical images for 21 fMRI studies of pain were downloaded from Neurovault (collection 1425). This dataset has been used in previous validations of existing meta-analytic tools (Maumet &amp;amp; Nichols, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 21 studies, 11 included Z maps for the relevant contrast, while the rest included T maps. T maps were converted to Z maps for IBMAs using z-statistics (i.e., Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, weighted Stouffer’s, Z MFX, and Z permutation). Each study contained contrast maps, which were used for RFX GLM, and contrast permutation IBMAs. Additionally, each study included standard error maps, which were used with the contrast maps for the FFX and MFX GLM IBMAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the RFX GLM, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, weighted Stouffer’s, and Z MFX IBMAs, Bonferroni correction was used. For the Z-permutation and contrast permutation IBMAs, 10000 iterations were used to build null distributions, and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction was employed for multiple comparisons correction. FDR correction was used instead of a more stringent Bonferroni correction because the resolution of the p-values for the permutation methods are dependent on the number of iterations performed. Finally, for the IBMAs performed through FSL (FFX GLM and MFX GLM), thresholding was applied with the FSL command cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the CBMAs, peaks and subpeaks were extracted from the thresholded maps in the Results packs. For all of the CBMAs except MKDA Chi2 with FDR, FWE correction was employed with 10000 iterations. For the MKDA meta-analyses, a kernel radius of 10mm was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thresholded results from each of these meta-analyses are shown in Figure 1. Each meta-analysis, both coordinate- and image-based, identifies right anterior insula, and most also include significant clusters in left anterior insula and middle cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As would be expected due to their failure to model important sources of variance, the image-based fixed effect procedures (i.e., FFX GLM, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, and Weighted Stouffer’s) spuriously produce numerically stronger results, and the coordinate-based methods find less expansive regions of activation but generally detect most of the pain network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NiMARE implements a range of meta-analytic algorithms with a standardized interface, and will soon be expanded to include tools for derivative analyses like meta-analytic connectivity modeling, meta-analytic parcellation, automated annotation, and functional decoding. This allows users to select the most appropriate meta-analytic tool for a given analysis, without having to learn or use novel packages which may be implemented very differently from one another. For example, the code needed to run an MFX GLM using both contrast maps and error maps, a Z permutation analysis using Z-maps, and an ALE meta-analysis using coordinates and sample sizes are all similar and can be run in the same framework.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chronic and acute nicotine alters intra- and inter-regional resting-state fMRI of the vmPFC</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bowen-nicotine-ohbm"/>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic nicotine use perturbs multiple neurobiological systems involved with, for example, reward processing, emotion regulation, and cognitive control [1-3]. Alterations within specific neurocircuits may contribute to distinct nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, anxiety, difficulty concentrating) [4] which make smoking cessation difficult. These aversive symptoms can be ameliorated to some degree by nicotine administration, which contributes to high relapse rates during early abstinence through negative reinforcement. Currently available pharmacological interventions (e.g., nicotine replacement, varenicline) vary in efficacy across individuals, highlighting the need to better characterize the underlying neurobiology linked with nicotine abstinence and administration. Brain regions linked with nicotine abstinence and administration may show alterations locally, in activity or connectivity, or remotely, in large-scale network integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a repeated measures within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, overnight-abstinent smokers (n=20) and nonsmokers (n=20) completed 6 fMRI sessions during a nicotine and varenicline crossover drug administration regime. We first conducted two whole-brain voxel-wise complementary measures of intra-regional synchronization; regional homogeneity (ReHo), the local temporal synchronization of brain activity [5], and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), the amplitude of spontaneous low frequency fluctuations [6]. A conjunction analysis of ReHo and fALFF outcomes comparing smokers vs. nonsmokers was conducted to identify convergent regions of altered local activity (pcorrected&amp;lt; 0.05). To further elucidate how intra-regional alterations were associated with inter-regional integration, areas of convergence identified above were then used as seed regions of interest in a resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis. For each subject and session, rsFC Z-maps from each seed region were submitted to group-level linear mixed effects modeling (pcorrected&amp;lt; 0.05). To enhance interpretations of rsFC outcomes, we utilized self-report metrics (affect, tobacco craving, nicotine withdrawal) in ancillary correlation analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smokers (vs. nonsmokers) showed decreased ReHo in the thalamus, middle occipital gyrus (MOG), fusiform gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and increased ReHo in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), medial frontal gyrus, and hippocampus. Smokers (vs. nonsmokers) also showed decreased fALFF in the thalamus, MTG, and cuneus, and increased fALFF in the vmPFC, hippocampus, cingulate, and globus pallidus. A conjunction of ReHo and fALFF outcomes identified convergence in the vmPFC, hippocampus, MTG, and cuneus (Fig. 1A). We then used convergent regions as seeds in a rsFC analysis to explore large-scale disruptions during nicotine administration. When considering the vmPFC seed, we observed a group (smoker vs. nonsmoker) by patch (nicotine vs. placebo) interaction, such that nicotine (vs. placebo) decreased rsFC with the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), frontal, parietal, and cerebellar regions among smokers, but not nonsmokers (Fig. 1B). Critically, rsFC between the vmPFC and insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and inferior parietal lobe was negatively correlated with positive affect (pcorrected&amp;lt; 0.05), whereas vmPFC-cerbellar rsFC was correlated with tobacco craving. When considering the hippocampal seed, we observed a patch effect, such that nicotine decreased rsFC with the fusiform gyrus, precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus. RsFC between the hippocampus and precuneus was positively correlated with self-reported withdrawal symptoms.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results provide support that alterations within specific neurocircuits may contribute to distinct aspects of nicotine withdrawal including affect, craving, and subjective withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics is a challenging academic pursuit wherein students regularly struggle to achieve success. Discouragingly, female students tend to underperform relative to their male peers on introductory physics conceptual inventories (1). Active engagement teaching is known to improve performance on these tests relative to lecture instruction methods (LI; 2), yet the neurocognitive networks linked to physics learning, pedagogy, and sex differences have not been evaluated. Modeling Instruction (MI) is one such active engagement approach that emphasizes experimentation and visualization, and supports learning in both males and females (3). Here, we used fMRI to delineate physics reasoning and retrieval-related brain networks in introductory physics students and probed for class, sex, and time-related differences resulting from a semester of MI or LI physics instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMRI data were acquired from 107 right-handed participants (55 MI, 52 LI; 48 female, 59 male; age 18-25) on a 3T GE 750W scanner. Participants were undergraduates at Florida International University and first-time enrollees in college-level LI or MI physics courses. Students completed one beginning-of-semester fMRI session (pre-instruction) and a second identical end-of-semester session (post-instruction) where they completed the Force Concept Inventory (FCI; 4) physics reasoning task, a physics and general knowledge retrieval (RETR) task, and a content-general transitive inference (TI) task. Analyses were performed in FSL and activation maps were generated and thresholded at P&amp;lt;0.05 (clusters z&amp;gt;2.3). Maps were computed by session individually, then class, sex, and longitudinal changes were assessed using a three-way fixed effects ANOVA to identify regions more engaged during task within one group relative to another, at the end relative to the beginning of the semester, and to test for significant interactions between class, sex, and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre- and post-instruction revealed similar activity in a fronto-parietal network (FPN) for FCI, RETR, and TI tasks (Fig. 1a). Behavioral results indicated students scored better post-instruction on FCI and RETR, but not on TI questions. We found learning-related changes in female and male LI and MI students within a mixed FPN and default mode network (DMN) associated with both physics tasks, but not with the TI task (Fig. 1b). Increased physics-related activity was observed at both time points in a FPN in male students, and in DMN and visual areas in female students (Fig. 2a). Significant interactions (class x sex x time) were observed during RETR in lingual and fusiform gyri, suggesting male and female students may engage brain areas differently during physics thinking, depending on whether they completed an LI or MI class (Fig. 2b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre- and post-instruction fMRI data from physics students revealed similar FPNs underlying physics thinking and transitive inference, consistent with known problem solving-related brain function (5). Increased FPN-DMN activity, accompanied by improved physics scores, following instruction suggest this network’s key role in physics learning, indicating potential reliance on memory-linked mental exploration during answer making (6). Sex differences in the neural systems supporting physics thinking may indicate dissociabilities in how students answer questions (7). However, brain function varied in sex-specific ways by class in visual regions, suggesting sex differences may be mitigated via increased emphasis on visualization and use of diagrams and pictures during reasoning, as well as enhanced incorporation of classroom demonstrations to promote physics understanding. To date, this is the first study to characterize how real-world classroom learning drives functional reorganization of large-scale brain networks among physics students. Our results indicate potential sex and pedagogy differences underlying the neural mechanisms supporting physics learning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Large-scale brain networks underlying domain-specific memory, intelligence, and academic performance</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic performance relies, in part, on memory and intelligence. These phenomena have been studied at length, but little is known about the role of brain connectivity in integrating memory and intelligence to support academic success. Even less is known about if and how these relationships vary between sexes. Here, we take a targeted approach to investigate brain networks underlying domain-specific memory, general intelligence, and academic performance, and how these measures differ among female versus male students in a historically male-dominated domain. We focused on the hippocampus, default mode, and central executive networks, which support internally- and externally-oriented processes underlying memory and task performance. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data were collected from 107 undergraduate students (47 female) following the completion of their first college-level physics course. Behavioral data included IQ and final course grade. 3T MR data included structural images and fMRI data collected while participants performed a novel memory retrieval task, with general and physics-specific conditions. Following preprocessing, connectivity matrices were calculated per condition, using networks meta-analytically delineated by Laird et al. (2011).[2] We compared between-network connectivity for the default mode network (DMN), left and right central executive networks (lCEN, rCEN) and hippocampus (Hc) across conditions for the whole sample and separately for each sex, between conditions across sex, and with respect to individual differences in behavioral measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, students answered more slowly and less accurately during physics versus general retrieval conditions, differences reflected by decreased rCEN-DMN and rCEN-lCEN connectivity (p&amp;lt;0.01; Figure 1, lower triangle). Male students responded more quickly than female students during both physics and general retrieval (p&amp;lt;0.05), but only more accurately during physics retrieval (p&amp;lt;0.01). There were no sex differences in general retrieval accuracy. Only Hc-lCEN connectivity differed between male and female students (p&amp;lt;0.05; Fig. 1, upper triangle), during physics retrieval. Within sex, female students demonstrated greater Hc-DMN connectivity during physics versus general retrieval (p&amp;lt;0.01) and male students demonstrated greater rCEN-DMN and rCEN-lCEN (p &amp;lt; 0.01) connectivity during general versus physics retrieval, likely driving these relationships in the whole sample (Fig. 1, upper triangle). While male students had significantly higher IQs (p&amp;lt;0.01) and IQ was significantly correlated with reaction time and accuracy across conditions (p&amp;lt;0.01), we found no relationship between IQ and course grade. Across the sample, there were no significant relationships between brain connectivity and course grade. When separated by sex, local efficiency within the lCEN was negatively correlated with grade (r = -0.356, p&amp;lt;0.01) in male, but not female students. Exploratory, whole-brain analyses revealed a more strongly connected subgraph during general versus physics retrieval, in which DMN, lCEN, rCEN, and a motor execution network showed high centrality (Figure 2), but no significant relationships between brain organization and IQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral differences between general and physics-specific memory were linked with differences in CEN and DMN connectivity, distinguishing processes by domain. The consistently stronger inter-network connectivity during general memory processing compared to physics-specific memory may reflect a Hebbian-like phenomenon, such that older (e.g., general) knowledge retrieval relies on a more strongly connected neural network than students’ newer (e.g., physics) knowledge retrieval.[3] However, female students showed greater coordination between the Hc and DMN, suggesting a reliance on autobiographical memories may facilitate domain-specific recall. Lastly, while performance on the physics retrieval task was predictive of course grade, no underlying neural contribution was detected.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>  Common and distinct brain regions associated with risky- and ambiguous decision-making</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision-making (DM) is an integral aspect of daily life and involves selecting an action from a set of available options or choices. Two often studied forms of uncertain DM are risky DM (choice outcome probabilities are generally known or easily inferred) and ambiguous DM (choice outcome probabilities are unknown or is same across available options). Common and distinct neurobiological correlates associated with risky and ambiguous DM domains, as well as specificity of such brain activity when compared to perceptual DM (acting as “control condition”), remains to be further clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic nicotine use perturbs multiple neurobiological systems involved with, for example, reward processing, emotion regulation, and cognitive control.
Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that extended nicotine use can be characterized by important differences in neural activity for both local (i.e. regional) and remote scales.
Neuronal synchrony facilitates coordination and organization of information processing in the brain, where changes in local activity profiles may affect remote integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The habenula (Hb) is a small epithalamic nucleus that modulates monoamine neurotransmission, possesses a high density of nAChRs, and is linked with the aversive effects of high nicotine doses &amp;amp; nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Preclinical evidence implicates the Hb as a contributor to negative reinforcement mechanisms perpetuating smoking. Although the Hb’s small size leads to difficulty assessing its function in humans, we utilized a feedback task previously shown to differentially activate the Hb, striatum, ACC, &amp;amp; insula.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>metaCurious: A neuroimaging web-application for meta-analytic curation and annotation</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging meta-analysis allows researchers to statistically assess consensus across published results, washing out error or bias in any one published study. Databases such as BrainMap and Neurosynth facilitate meta-analysis by indexing results and meta-data from published neuroimaging papers. The two are populated by contrasting approaches: BrainMap relies on manual, human annotation, while Neurosynth takes an automated approach. BrainMap’s method yields more detailed, precise information, but is resource intensive and unable to keep up with accelerating publication of neuroimaging papers. Neurosynth keeps up with publication volume, but does not include finer details of papers’ results, which are useful for meta-analysis. The Brainspell database integrates the merits of each and addresses their drawbacks. Building on Neurosynth’s volume of automatically curated results, it allows researchers to manually annotate and correct results a la BrainMap. Here, we present metaCurious, a web application for user interaction with Brainspell’s database. metaCurious facilitates user annotation of the automatically gathered results from Neurosynth, allowing researchers to add details, such as number of subjects and stereotaxic space, and correct errors in the automatically collected neuroimaging results. In addition to adding the human element to automated database population, metaCurious integrates with GitHub to facilitate researcher collaboration in curating “Collections” of neuroimaging experiments for eventual meta-analysis. metaCurious will minimize the burden of with finding, annotating, and extracting data from neuroimaging papers for meta-analysis. To advance the curation of published research, metaCurious is being developed in conjunction with the ATHENA project, to use the classification algorithm for further annotation of the literature. ATHENA presents a middle-point between Neurosynth’s approach to annotate papers with only their most frequently used terms, without incurring the costs of manual annotation. Facilitating ATHENA’s annotation will allow metaCurious to provide more information to users, increasing the ease of meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic performance is believed to rely, in part, on intelligence. This phenomena has been studied at length, but findings concerning the neural substrates of intelligence in intrinsic brain organization have been mixed, and little attention has been paid to how the relationships between intelligence and brain organization vary between sexes.
Here, we investigate the role of IQ in domain-specific learning in a historically male-dominated domain. We further probe how the intrinsic organization of large-scale brain networks reflects IQ and its role in learning, and how this relationship differs with respect to biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumor microenvironment (TME) cells constitute a vital element of tumor tissue. Increasing evidence has elucidated their clinicopathologic significance in predicting outcomes and therapeutic efficacy. Nonetheless, no studies have reported a systematic analysis of cellular interactions in the TME. In this study, we comprehensively estimated the TME infiltration patterns of 1,524 gastric cancer patients and systematically correlated the TME phenotypes with genomic characteristics and clinicopathologic features of gastric cancer using two proposed computational algorithms. Three TME phenotypes were defined, and the TMEscore was constructed using principal component analysis algorithms. The high TMEscore subtype was characterized by immune activation and response to virus and IFNγ. Activation of transforming growth factor β, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis pathways were observed in the low TMEscore subtype, which are considered T-cell suppressive and may be responsible for significantly worse prognosis in gastric cancer [hazard ratio (HR), 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.54; P &amp;lt; 0.001]. Multivariate analysis revealed that the TMEscore was an independent prognostic biomarker, and its value in predicting immunotherapeutic outcomes was also confirmed (IMvigor210 cohort: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.89; P = 0.008; GSE78220 cohort: HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.89; P = 0.021). Depicting a comprehensive landscape of the TME characteristics of gastric cancer may, therefore, help to interpret the responses of gastric tumors to immunotherapies and provide new strategies for the treatment of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nicotine reduces habenula activity during performance feedback among abstinent cigarette smokers</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/sutherland-acnp-poster"/>
   <updated>2018-12-13T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most smokers attempting to quit will fail often due to nicotine withdrawal symptoms including negative affect, irritability (enhanced responsivity to negative outcomes), and anhedonia (reduced responsivity to positive outcomes) [1, 2]. While such withdrawal symptoms are a product of dysregulated reward processing and the ventral striatum (VS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula are regarded as constituents in the neurocircuitry of addiction [3, 4], emerging preclinical evidence implicates the habenula (Hb) as a contributor to negative reinforcement mechanisms perpetuating smoking [5]. The Hb is a small and understudied epithalamic nucleus that integrates information from limbic forebrain regions to modulate midbrain structures involved in monoamine neurotransmission. Specifically, the Hb inhibits dopamine releasing neurons following the absence of expected rewards [6], possesses a high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [7], and is linked with the aversive effects of nicotine withdrawal and high nicotine doses [7, 8]. While the Hb’s small size limits its assessment in human fMRI studies [9], we utilized a performance feedback task previously shown to differentially activate the Hb, VS, ACC, and insula [10]. Our aims were three-fold, to: (a) characterize brain activity associated with positive and negative performance feedback (task effect), (b) elucidate brain activity differences as a function of a chronic smoking history (group effect: smokers vs. nonsmokers), and (c) delineate activity modulations as a function of acute pharmacological administration (drug effect: nicotine and varenicline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight-abstinent smokers (n = 17) and nonsmokers (n = 17) participated in 6 fMRI sessions during a two-drug, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. All participants were assessed twice (PATCH factor: once each wearing a transdermal nicotine patch and a placebo patch) at three points during a varenicline administration regimen (PILL factor: pre-pill, varenicline pill, placebo pill). Participants completed questionnaires to quantify trait-levels of addiction severity (FTND) and state-levels of negative affect and social anhedonia. To probe Hb functioning, we employed a ‘motion prediction task’ [10] in which participants predicted which of two movingballs, starting from different locations and traveling at different speeds, would reach a finish line first after viewing a short sequence of the balls’ motion. Task difficulty wasdynamically adapted thereby maintaining error rates at ~35% so that participants remained uncertain about their performance until feedback presentation. Participant responses (correct vs. error) were followed by feedback that did or did not provide information about trial outcomes (informative vs. non-informative). Task effects were assessed in a dependent samples t-test (informative-correct vs. informative-error trials, pcorrected &amp;lt; 0.001), group effects were assessed in an independent samples t-test (smokers vs. nonsmokers, pcorrected&amp;lt;0.05), and drug effects in an ANOVA (PILL by PATCH among smokers, pcorrected &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding task effects, across all participants, we largely replicated a previous implementation of the task [10] and observed increased activity following negative feedback notably in the Hb, ACC, and bilateral anterior insula, and increased activity following positive feedback in the bilateral VS. Regarding group effects, smokers (vs. nonsmokers) showed reduced responsivity to positive feedback in the bilateral VS, yet increased responsivity to negative feedback in the left insula. Notably, greater reductions in VS responsivity following positive feedback correlated with higher FTND scores among smokers (r[16] = 0.60, p = 0.02) and more self-reported negative affect across all participants (PANAS, r[33] = 0.48, p = 0.004). Regarding drug effects, we observed a PATCH main effect such that placebo (vs. nicotine) administration was linked with elevated Hb activity following positive feedback among smokers, but not nonsmokers. A repeated measures correlation assessment among smokers indicated that greater Hb activity following positive feedback was linked with greater self-reported social anhedonia (r[74] = 0.28, p = 0.02), this relation was not observed among nonsmokers. No significant clusters were observed when considering the PILL or PILL by PATCH effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results support contemporary views that an extended smoking history is associated with reduced responsivity to positive outcomes (anhedonia) and enhanced responsivity to negative outcomes (irritability). Critically, our results contribute to a growing literature demonstrating Hb involvement in positive and negative outcome processing and provide novel evidence that Hb activity in smokers can be modulated by nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Immune cell infiltration as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of stage I-III colon cancer​</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumour-infiltrating immune cells are a source of important prognostic information for patients with resectable colon cancer. We developed a novel immune model based on systematic assessments of the immune landscape inferred from bulk tumor transcriptomes of stage I-III colon cancer patients. The “Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT)” algorithm was used to estimate the fraction of 22 immune cell types from six microarray public datasets. The random forest method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model were then used to establish immunoscores for diagnosis and prognosis. By comparing immune cell compositions in samples of 870 colon cancer patients and 70 normal controls, we constructed a diagnostic model, designated the diagnostic immune risk score (dIRS), that showed high specificity and sensitivity in both the training [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98, p &amp;lt; 0.001] and validation (AUC 0.96, p &amp;lt; 0.001) sets. We also established a prognostic immune risk score (pIRS) that was found to be an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival in every series (training: HR 2.23; validation: HR 1.65; entire: HR 2.01; p &amp;lt; 0.001 for all), which showed better prognostic value than TNM stage. In addition, integration of the pIRS with clinical characteristics in a composite nomogram showed improved accuracy of relapse risk prediction, providing a higher net benefit than TNM stage, with well-fitted calibration curves. The proposed dIRS and pIRS models represent promising novel signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Functional connectivity of striatal subregions as a function of chronic cigarette smoking and acute nicotine administration</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive animal and human research implicates the ventral striatum (VS) and its interconnected circuitry in reward processing and addiction. Dysregulated VS resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has been linked with nicotine use and a failure to maintain abstinence. However, differential rsFC of striatal subregions remains to be more fully characterized as a function of a smoking trait (smoker vs. nonsmoker) and pharmacological state (nicotine withdrawal vs. administration). As such, we performed seed-based rsFC assessments on fMRI data (8 min) collected from overnight abstinent smokers (n=24; 12 females; age=36 ±10) and nonsmokers (n=20; 10 females; age=30±7) following administration of nicotine (via patch), varenicline (via pill), both, or neither (placebo-controlled). We employed two bilateral VS seeds (right and left superior VS seeds [RVSs, LVSs] and right and left inferior VS seeds [RVSi, LVSi]) and assessed group effects (smoker vs. nonsmoker collapsed across drug sessions in independent samples t-tests) and drug effects (e.g., nicotine vs. placebo in a linear whole-brain mixed effects ANOVA using AFNI’s 3dLME). Regarding group effects, smokers (relative to nonsmokers) showed significantly greater rsFC between the RVSi seed and the medial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex, whereas the LVSs seed showed greater rsFC with the superior frontal gyrus (Fig. 1A.). Regarding drug effects, we observed that among smokers, nicotine (vs. placebo) administration significantly reduced the rsFC between the RVSs seed and a cluster encompassing the insula, putamen, and parahippocampal gyrus (Pvoxelwise&amp;lt;0.005, cluster extent: 213 voxels, Pcorrected&amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 1B.). No effect of Varenicline was observed. Taken together, these outcomes indicate that the rsFC of VS subregions are differentially impacted as a function of a smoking trait (smokers vs. nonsmokers) and the current pharmacological state of a smoker (nicotine vs. placebo).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>DIVA: Dense investigation of variability in affect</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/projects/diva"/>
   <updated>2018-10-05T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/projects/diva</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;DIVA is a 3-month longitudinal study in which we acquired weekly neuroimaging and electrophysiological data, in addition to biweekly endocrine, neuropsychological, and actigraphic data for a small sample of ~3 participants to capture fluctuations in the brain, sleep, exercise, mood, and stress over the course of three complete menstrual cycles.
Participants completed twice-weekly self-report questionnaires about their sleep, exercise, mood, stress, contraceptive use, and physical state; weekly 2-hour MRI sessions, including an assortment of cognitive tasks in addition to naturalistic movie-watching, resting, and structural scans, with concurrent electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, and respiration recordings; twice-weekly vocal recordings; and twice weekly saliva sample collection, for measuring hormones.
Additionally, participants wore FitBit activity trackers for the duration of the study, which provide measures of heart rate, sleep, exercise, etc. daily over the course of the study.
These data will provide an insight into sources of variability in brain structure and function, across cognitive and behavioral contexts, as well as how they interact over the course of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIVA was launched in February 2020 and was unfortunately discontinued in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NiMARE: A Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-poster"/>
   <updated>2018-08-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/salo-nimare-poster</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present NiMARE, a Python package for performing meta-analyses of the neuroimaging literature. While meta-analytic packages exist which implement one or two algorithms each, NiMARE provides a standard syntax for performing a wide range of analyses and for interacting with databases of coordinates and images from fMRI studies (e.g., brainspell, Neurosynth, and Neurovault). NiMARE joins a growing Python ecosystem for neuroimaging research, which includes such tools as nipype, nistats, and nilearn. As with these other tools, NiMARE is open source, collaboratively developed, and built with ease of use in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a demonstration of NiMARE’s capabilities, we have performed a series of image- and coordinate-based meta-analyses of a set of 21 fMRI studies of pain taken from Neurovault. NiMARE contains implementations of the nine image-based meta-analytic methods described in Maumet and Nichols (2016; MFX GLM, RFX GLM, FFX GLM, Contrast Permutation, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, Weighted Stouffer’s, Z MFX, and Z Permutation), as well as five coordinate-based methods (ALE, SCALE, MKDA density analysis, MKDA chi-square analysis, and KDA density analysis). Results from each of these meta-analyses are shown in Figure 1. As would be expected, the image-based fixed effect procedures are much more sensitive than mixed and random effects, and the coordinate-based methods find less expansive regions of activation but generally pick up most of the pain network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to develop classifiers for automatically annotating neuroimaging research articles with labels from the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology. We examined classifier performance when varying corpus (abstract-only vs full-text), feature space (bag-of-words vs Cognitive Atlas), classifiers (BnB, knn, lr, svm). The most optimal classification performance across labels utilized full-text with bag-of-words and the logistic regression algorithm. When only considering abstract-text, the Cognitive Atlas features outperformed the bag-of-words features. We also found that anatomical terms dominated the features used for classification/&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quantitative comparison of functional decoding approaches across meta-analytic frameworks</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bottenhorn-decoding-poster"/>
   <updated>2018-08-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional decoding is an analytic method that seeks to determine the most consistent brain structure-function relationships; this approach typically relies on a large database of neuroimaging results. Two frameworks, Neurosynth (NS) and BrainMap (BM), offer quantitative functional decoding free of researcher bias, but their implementations differ as NS annotates each study with a bag-of-words approach, while BM relies on a structured vocabulary. To assess these differences, we performed a quantitative comparison by decoding a set of 15 ROIs using both NS and BM. NS terms were coded as “functional” (functional or subject-related) or “non-functional” (non-content or anatomical) and compared to BM terms. We observed that 43% of NS’s terms were functional, with 80% of those not corresponding to a term in BM’s taxonomy. Conversely, of BM’s terms, 44% were not represented in NS’s lexicon. Further analysis revealed that characteristics of decoded ROIs (i.e., size, false positive activation rate) were unrelated to the proportion of noise in NS decoding results or the number of significant terms returned by BM. Average correlation of NS terms analogous to BM terms was 0.09, compared to an average correlation of 0.36 for the top 50 functional NS terms. Overall, we observed that NS’s functional terms provide high specificity, but require filtering through many non-informative terms. In contrast, BM provides broad descriptions that less accurately relate function to brain activations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smokers attempting to quit will often fail due to nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include anxiety, irritability (enhanced sensitivity to negative outcomes), and anhedonia (reduced sensitivity to positive outcomes). To characterize brain activity associated with positive and negative outcomes, as well as differences between smokers and nonsmokers, we utilized a performance feedback fMRI task called the motion prediction (MP) task and collected data from abstinent smokers (n=24) and nonsmoking controls (n=20). We first assessed task effects by characterizing brain activity associated with performance feedback across both smoking and nonsmoking groups and then assessed group effects by identifying differences in brain activity between smokers and nonsmokers. In the MP task participants were presented with positive and negative performance feedback (correct vs. error) that did, or did not, provide information about trial outcomes (informative vs. non-informative). Differential activations on error-trials vs. correct-trials followed by informative, but not non-informative, feedback (response x feedback interaction) were anticipated in task-related regions. Regarding task effects, we found that negative feedback increased activity in the insula, rostral motor cingulate area/supplementary motor area (rCMA) and a habenular/thalamic region, whereas positive feedback increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS; pcorrected &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig.1). These results replicate previously reported task effects and extend the body of literature on human habenula (Hb) activity. Regarding group effects, abstinent smokers vs. nonsmokers displayed elevated insula activity following negative feedback and decreased VS activity following positive feedback (pcorrected &amp;lt; 0.05; Fig.2). These group differences are consistent with a hypodopaminergic view of drug withdrawal and speak to the effect of nicotine withdrawal on performance feedback processing brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Combined impact of HIV and cannabis use on insular functional connectivity</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurocognitive alterations have been independently documented among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those who regularly use cannabis (CB), but the combined impact on functional connectivity (FC) has yet to be considered. Given the neurocognitive deficits caused by HIV (Heaton et al., 2011) and the suggested brain metabolic alterations in frontal white matter pathways from HIV and cannabis (Chang et al., 2006), we delineated alterations in FC of various insular (INS) regions presumably subserving cognitive functions among HIV and CB-using participants.73 individuals (21 HIV+/CB+; 19 HIV+/CB-; 21 HIV-CB+; 12 HIV-CB-) underwent resting-state fMRI. Resting-state FC analyses were performed using bilateral anterior (a), middle (m), and posterior (p) INS seeds. To investigate the independent and combined impact of HIV and CB, whole-brain connectivity maps were generated for each ROI and compared across groups (threshold: p-voxel&amp;lt;0.001; p-cluster: p&amp;lt;0.05).Among HIV+ participants (main effect) the left aINS demonstrated reduced FC with the anterior and posterior cingulate, the right aINS showed reduced FC with the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and striatum, and the right mINS showed reduced FC with the left insula and striatum. The right pINS showed an HIV x CB interaction with the left inferior parietal lobule/supramarginal gyrus (IPL; Figure 1 inset). Specifically, among HIV- participants pINS-IPL FC was reduced in CB users, however, among HIV+ individuals such FC was increased among CB users (Figure 1).We identified alterations in INS FC associated with HIV in frontal, striatal, and cingulate regions. These outcomes are consistent with HIV-related fronto-striatal dysfunction and associated cognitive impairment (Plessis et al., 2014). Interestingly, CB use among HIV+ individuals appeared to normalize insula-parietal lobe FC. INS FC alterations may mediate some aspects of cognitive dysfunction associated with HIV infection and/or CB use.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Uncovering the Neural Substrates of Physics Problem Solving: A New Paradigm with Behavior Correlates</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bartley-physics-poster"/>
   <updated>2017-06-29T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics education research examines how students think about physics to facilitate learning, which is often measured via physics problem solving (PPS) abilities. Behavioral studies have focused on understanding the sequential, cognitively diverse processes and factors influencing PPS success [1]. For example, science anxiety negatively impacts PPS performance [2], whereas visuospatial skills are positively associated with PPS [3]. Currently, no neuroimaging study has characterized the neural correlates of PPS, although investigations of numeric tasks have begun to map brain dynamics across problem stages, noting differential fronto-parietal contributions across time [4]. To provide insight into the neural mechanisms of PPS, we developed a new fMRI paradigm, probed brain activity across PPS stages, and evaluated brain-behavior correlates with anxiety and visuospatial skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acquired fMRI data from 56 healthy right-handed participants (29 female; aged 18-24). Participants were Florida International University undergraduates enrolled in college-level introductory physics. Students completed generalized and science anxiety inventories and WAIS behavioral testing. Students underwent fMRI immediately after physics course conclusion wherein they solved physics problems based on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI); a widely used test of physics conceptual understanding [5]. FCI (and ‘Control’) questions were presented via three self-paced screens: S1 consisted of text and picture descriptions of a physical scene, S2 posed a physics question, and S3 listed possible answer choices (Fig 1ab). Analyses were performed in FSL and activation maps (FCI - Control) were thresholded at P&amp;lt;0.05 (clusters z&amp;gt;3.09) for S1-3 concatenated and S1, S2, and S3 separately. We assessed correlations between resultant S1-3 ROI parameter estimates and WAIS (total and subtests), general and science anxiety scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPS was linked with bilateral activity in the prefrontal cortex, frontal poles, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobules (PL), temporal gyri, and cerebellum (Fig 1c). Screen-wise analyses confirmed distinct activation during sequential PPS stages (Fig 1c). S1 evoked bilateral insula, superior frontal sulci, inferior frontal gyri, superior PL, postcentral sulci, posterior cingulate (PCC), thalamus, and occipitotemporal activity. Limited S2 activations occurred in right intraparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, bilateral superior PL, and superior frontal sulci. S3 engaged a left-lateralized frontal-parietal network with PCC and middle temporal activation. High WIAS Visual Puzzles subtest performance was linked to increased PPS-related activity in the left frontal pole, left inferior PL, and right supramarginal gyrus. We observed negative correlations in the same ROIs for science anxiety. Full WAIS and generalized anxiety scores did not correlate with PPS-related activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMRI data from college physics students identified fronto-tempo-parietal activity during PPS. Differential activation occurred across PPS stages, suggesting system-level brain dynamics support stepwise problem solving. PL, frontal, and salience network recruitment in S1 may detect semantic conflicts in text [6], transient S2 PL activity might guide attentional visual focus [7], and cooperation between default mode and frontal areas in S3 is consistent with reasoning involving autobiographic events [8]. PPS-related activity positively correlated with visuospatial reasoning but negatively correlated with science anxiety in a frontopolar area, involved in top-down emotion reappraisal during cognition [9], the supramarginal gyrus, which discriminates between spatial cues [10], and inferior PL, which supports episodic memory-based reasoning [8]. These results suggest students who experience science anxiety may have reduced capacity to mobilize cognitive resources when faced with negative emotional responses across problem solving stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) [1] is a multidimensional approach to precision medicine for psychiatry [2]. This includes a diagnostic system based on core criteria, yet the correspondence of RDoC domain definitions to existing neurobiological data has not been fully established. Evolution from an organizational framework to diagnostic implementation necessitates characterizing how RDoC domains map onto the healthy human brain. RDoC designates social processing as one of five domains of mental function, and is fractionated into four constructs (Fig. 1): affiliation and attachment, social communication, perception of self, and perception of others. Our present objective was to unpack these social processing constructs from a data-driven perspective in order to: (1) investigate the feasibility of neuroimaging task classification under RDoC domain definitions, (2) ascertain if the RDoC framework corresponds to different or overlapping social brain regions using brain meta-analysis, (3) evaluate the correspondence between the specialized function-structure relationships of the social brain across all domains of brain function and social task themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand how RDoC social processing constructs correspond to task-based fMRI activation, we performed a PubMed search to identify a corpus of social neuroimaging experiments. For each published experiment, the task was identified, assigned a task label, and categorized according to the RDoC social processing construct definitions. Whole-brain coordinates were extracted, meta-analyzed using ALE, and significance tested at a cluster-level corrected threshold of p&amp;lt;0.05 (cluster forming threshold at voxel-level p&amp;lt;0.001) [3]. Neurosynth [4] functional decoding was performed on the ALE maps, providing a broad range of associated mental function terms. Term-based social network analysis (SNA) was performed using R and Cytoscape to identify the strength of thematic associations between task labels assigned during the literature search and Neurosynth terms, thus creating a data-driven exploration of the correspondence of RDoC constructs to broad function-structure relationships in the social brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social neuroimaging corpus included 132 experiments reporting 1,425 foci. The ensuing meta-analysis results revealed different regions of convergence across RDoC social constructs, including amygdala and bilateral temporo-occipital cortex for affiliation and attachment; dorsolateral PFC extending into Broca’s area, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum for social communication; medial PFC, right insula and claustrum for perception of self; and left dorsomedial PFC, medial PFC, and medial posterior cortex for perception others. SNA of the Neurosynth decoding results revealed functional roles unique to each construct (e.g., reward, autobiographical, language), as well as versatile functional attributions shared between constructs (e.g., social, emotion, faces). SNA of construct thematic task associations revealed distinct collections of social task themes (e.g., mother view infant, imitation) and strength of task correspondence to each construct (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observed that classification of the neuroimaging literature according to distinct social processing constructs within the RDoC framework consistently activates separate nodes within the extended social brain. Moreover, the combined functional decoding and SNA demonstrated that activation of cliques within the social brain are context-driven and rely on the unique experimental design and task selection of a given neuroimaging study. Our results establish a comparison of specialized tasks utilized in social neuroimaging with the full range of automated terms comprising human mental function, thus providing a comprehensive aperture into differences between theory driven specialization and large scale, data-driven reverse inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurosynth is a meta-analytic neuroimaging resource that provides users with tools to synthesize the fMRI literature. Neurosynth’s large-scale analyses are made possible by automated data extraction and annotation. While noise rates have been estimated for Neurosynth’s data extraction routines [1], no research has evaluated its annotation process or examined how this process influences meta-analytic results. As such, we applied Neurosynth’s annotation method to an expert-annotated corpus to compare the two types of annotations. Additionally, we performed simulations using Neurosynth’s chi-square test to measure how prediction precision and sample size affect power to detect true meta-analytic effects (i.e., activity associated with a given experimental manipulation in the underlying population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We utilized a corpus of 2,978 articles, where each paper was annotated using CogPO [2], a taxonomy for describing fMRI research. For a subset of 60 labels drawn from 4 fields (Behavioral Domain, Paradigm Class, Diagnosis, and Instruction), search terms were composed to combine the most relevant terms to identify each label (e.g., “pain” or “painful” for the label Pain). Labels were predicted by applying the searches to Neurosynth’s annotation model. From these predictions, the proportion of selected papers that are relevant to a given label (PPV) and the proportion of papers not selected for the sample that were correctly excluded (NPV) were calculated. These measures were combined with assumptions of average true (8%; cf. [3]) and false positive rates (0.75%, using results from [4]) in fMRI experiments to perform chi-square tests (as in Neurosynth). These tests were performed to estimate a minimum necessary sample size (NMIN) for a given level of performance. In essence, the ability of a Neurosynth meta-analysis (threshold: punc&amp;lt;0.001) to detect a true effect associated with a construct labeled in CogPO is dependent on both Neurosynth’s annotation performance (PPV/NPV) and the representation of that search term in Neurosynth’s database (NDB). Finally, NMIN was compared against NDB to determine if performance was sufficient for that label. To characterize the distribution of expected values for each label, 25 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation were employed, producing 125 estimates per label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurosynth’s predictions were accurate enough to detect true effects meta-analytically in 43 of the 60 labels, with &amp;gt;50% reaching sufficient performance (i.e., NDB &amp;gt; NMIN) in &amp;gt;90% of iterations (Fig. 1). NMIN tended to decrease as the fraction of significant iterations increased (Fig. 2).
Both high- and low-performing labels were represented across all four fields, indicating that the performance of Neurosynth’s annotations depends more on each label’s linguistic properties than on differences between fields. Qualitatively, labels best described by a small set of relatively monosemous terms (e.g., “pain”/”painful” for the label Pain) were the most accurate. Conversely, labels described by common or long (&amp;gt;2 words) terms (e.g., substance use disorder) tended to perform worse. However, regardless of the terms used to describe each label, many labels contain information that is rarely reported in abstracts and may be implicitly encoded via the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurosynth’s annotation method is able to detect true effects for most common labels. However, in spite of the tool’s high performance, many labels do not achieve significance (i.e., NDB &amp;lt; NMIN). This includes several paradigms/domains of interest to researchers and diagnostic terms needed to exclude clinical samples.
Based on these performance estimates, it is possible that Neurosynth could benefit from a more advanced annotation procedure, such as the classifiers proposed in [5], which may provide more content-relevant patterns. These performance estimates may also aid users in determining which searches are more meaningful when they perform meta-analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Behavioral decoding of functionally related brain areas consistently linked to drug cue reactivity</title>

   <updated>2017-06-26T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As drug cues likely play a role in sustaining drug use and precipitating relapse, a substantial body of neuroimaging work has utilized cue-reactivity paradigms [1-3]. Cue-related activity has been observed in multiple brain regions including the striatum, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and cingulate cortex [1-3]. However, cue-reactivity and by extension drug craving are complex multifaceted psychological constructs likely comprising multiple elemental cognitive operations (e.g., attention, memory, emotion, reward-related processes) [4-6]. In a typical cue-reactivity paradigm, it is difficult to parcellate these more precise mental operations. As such, we first conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of drug cue-reactivity paradigms to identify brain regions showing convergent activation across studies. Next, we employed database driven tools to identify pairs of cue-related clusters functionally related across neuroimaging tasks. We then delineated behavioral phenomena associated with these functional interactions via behavioral decoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We performed a literature search for studies reporting whole-brain cue reactivity results and reported activity modulation for substance&amp;gt;neutral stimuli contrasts. Convergent activity modulations were identified across studies via the coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) framework (FWE corrected Pcluster&amp;lt;0.05, CDT of P&amp;lt;0.001) [7]. Four clusters obtained from this cue-reactivity meta-analysis were utilized as regions of interest (ROIs) in a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) assessment [8]. MACM identifies brain areas that simultaneously co-activate with user-specified seeds across studies probing various behavioral domains and task paradigms. Whole-brain coordinates that co-activated with the seeds were extracted and used as ALE input thus delineating cluster of convergent co-activation (FWE corrected Pcluster&amp;lt;0.05, CDT of P&amp;lt;0.001). The degree to which one ROI’s map intersected with other ROIs was quantified and we considered this overlap as an indication of a functional connection between regions. Lastly, we employed functional decoding using forward and reverse inference analyses on metadata terms stored in the BrainMap database [9] to identify behavioral phenomena associated with these functional connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified convergent cue-related brain activity modulation in the amygdala, caudate, mPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (Fig 1a). We then generated co-activation maps for each of these clusters using MACM (Fig 1b). To represent cue-related brain regions which were functionally-related across other neuroimaging tasks, the intersection of one ROI’s MACM map with the other clusters was assessed (Fig 2a). For example, the left amygdala co-activation map (ROI 1) overlapped with the mPFC (ROI 3) and right caudate (ROI 2); whereas the left amygdala ROI was overlapped by the MACM map derived for the left PCC (ROI 4). Functional decoding delineated behavioral phenomena linked with coactivation of these functionally-related ROIs. Specifically, coactivation of the amygdala and caudate (Fig 2b, path ROI 1-2), as well as coactivation of the PCC and amygdala (path ROI 4-1), was associated with the behavioral domain of emotion. Coactivation of the mPFC and PCC (path ROI 3-4) was linked with cognition specifically social/semantic paradigms, and coactivation of caudate and PCC was related to cognition, emotion, and reward (path ROI 2-4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drug cue reactivity was associated with convergent functional modulation in the amygdala, caudate, mPFC and PCC. Beyond cue-reactivity paradigms, these brain regions also co-activate with a wide range brain regions involved in cognition, emotion and reward. Overall, our findings emphasize brain regions and neurocircuits linked to drug cue reactivity and suggest more precise elemental mental operations that may be associated with specific region-to-region functional interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Meta-analytic clustering dissociates activation and behavior profiles across reward processing data</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad psychological construct of reward processing involves multiple aspects, including assigning value to sensory stimuli, learning outcome contingencies, and adapting behavior to maximize desired outcomes [1-2]. As neuroimaging studies often utilize complex reward processing tasks, it can be difficult to associate specific brain regions/networks with distinct aspects of reward processing. To elucidate brain regions, and in turn networks, consistently involved in reward processing and the more precise mental operations they support, we applied an emergent meta-analytic clustering approach to the extensive body of reward processing neuroimaging results archived in the BrainMap database (www.brainmap.org). We created meta-analytic groupings (MAGs) of experiments based on the similarity of brain activation patterns and then performed behavioral inference assessments on those MAGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first constructed a pair-wise cross-correlation matrix quantifying the similarity between brain activation patterns from each of the 712 experiments in BrainMap classified under the reward, gambling, classical conditioning, and delay discounting meta-analytic labels. We then performed k-means clustering across multiple model orders to organize experiments into MAGs by maximizing between-group differences and minimizing within-group differences of experiment correlation distributions. Next, significant convergence of brain activation for each MAG in the optimal model order (determined by 4 cluster stability metrics) was computed using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) [3]. Finally, we performed exploratory analyses to generate behavioral profiles for each MAG using metadata about the task specifics associated with each contributing experiment. As assigned BrainMap metadata may lack experiment-specific details, we enhanced this information by re-coding more precise task features (e.g., risk vs. amount, reward omission) associated with each experiment using a blind, inter-rater reliability approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clustering metrics indicated that 4 MAGs was the optimal parcellation of the 712 reward processing experiments. ALE images generated for each MAG (Fig. 1) identified dissociable regions of convergent activation linked with reward processing, including the amygdala (MAG1, orange), anterior insula, dlPFC (MAG2, green), OFC, mPFC (MAG3, blue), striatum and cingulate (MAG4, purple). The behavioral profile for MAG4 (Fig. 2, purple), involved the terms reward omission, unexpected outcomes, outcome valence, and anticipation, and was generally consistent with a well-characterized role in reward prediction error (RPE) encoding [4]. The behavioral profile for MAG2 (Fig. 2, green) included the terms reward learning, rewarded performance, and rewarded accuracy, suggesting a role in learning outcome contingencies and adapting future behavior [5-6]. The behavioral profile for MAG1 (Fig. 2, orange) included the terms delay, delay discounting, outcome probability, and decision advice, and the profile for MAG3 (Fig. 2, blue) included the terms amount estimation, reward price, purchasing, aversive avoidance, and predator-prey paradigm. These profiles suggest that both MAGs are involved in using information to predict outcomes, with perhaps MAG3 more strongly linked with negative outcomes and motivating avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four MAGs with distinct brain activation patterns and behavioral profiles were identified across reward processing experiments, involving RPE encoding (MAG4), outcome learning (MAG2), value prediction (MAG1, MAG3), and negative value prediction (MAG3). Our meta-analytic results correspond with distinct steps in the RPE learning model [5-7]. This quantitative parcellation of reward processing experiments highlights the potential utility of meta-analytic strategies to dissociate brain activation patterns, during complex cognitive processes, across a large body of neuroimaging experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Connectivity of the human habenula using 7T resting state and meta-analytic coactivation modeling</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bottenhorn-habenula-poster"/>
   <updated>2017-06-26T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/bottenhorn-habenula-poster</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The habenula, a small, bilateral region posterior to the medial thalamus and dorsal to the posterior commissure, has been of interest in research on reward processing and goal-directed behavior. It receives input from the prefrontal cortex and several subcortical regions and projects to the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, as well as the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN)[1]. Despite the habenula’s critical involvement in reward processing and dopamine modulation, few neuroimaging studies have focused on this region. To address this discrepancy, we used complementary approaches to assess the whole brain functional connectivity of the habenula both at rest and during task to uncover how this region may be differentially engaged across cognitive states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the habenula, data were collected from 28 healthy participants on a 7-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM scanner at Auburn University. Structural T1 scans were acquired at a resolution of 0.63mmx0.63mmx0.60mm and 5 minutes of resting state data were acquired with an EPI sequence at a resolution of 0.85mmx0.85mmx1.5mm. Structural images were first aligned in in SPM8 and the habenula was manually defined in each subject’s native space, by a procedure described by Lawson et al. [2]. We then used FSL’s FEAT to regress each subject’s mean habenula time series on the voxel-wise time series across the brain. A nonparametric one-sample t-test was performed at the group-level with FSL’s randomise [3].
Meta-analytic coactivation modeling (MACM) [4] was performed using an ROI drawn by a similar method on an MNI152 template brain, dilated to account for anatomical and data processing differences across studies. We used the BrainMap database to identify studies reporting activation in this ROI across a wide range of functional neuroimaging paradigms. ALE [5,6] was used to assess coactivation across studies, thresholded at a cluster-level corrected threshold of p&amp;lt;0.05 (cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level p&amp;lt;0.001) [7]. We then performed a conjunction analysis on the results of the two analyses to determine areas in common, as well as a contrast analysis to identify regions of significant difference between rsFC and MACM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rsFC analysis identified functional synchrony of the habenula with ventral anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (vACC, PCC), right anterior insula (AI), SN, periaqueductal gray (PAG), precuneus, and striatum (Figure 1A). MACM results identified coactivation in portions of the striatum, dorsal ACC (dACC), medial frontal gyrus, and in both left inferior frontal sulcus and posterior parietal lobule (Figure 1B). Both rsFC and MACM revealed connectivity with the nearby thalamus, ACC, SN, and PAG (Figure 1C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate in both rsFC and MACM analyses habenula’s functional interactions with the SN, consistent with a well-documented role in modulating dopaminergic signaling associated with reward prediction error (RPE), indicating this relationship is central to habenula function, regardless of cognitive state. While we observed habenula connectivity with the ACC both at rest and during various tasks, the region of conjunction in ACC was small. The habenula’s rsFC was largely restricted to vACC, and task-based MACM, to dACC. This is an important distinction, as rsFC and MACM demonstrate differential connectivity of the habenula with respect to cognitive state. The habenula appeared to be connected with PCC, precuneus, and vACC at rest, which are medial nodes of the default mode network [8]. During tasks, the habenula was connected with both AI and dACC, which are key nodes of the salience network, connections that are supported by an underlying structural architecture [1,9]. Differential connectivity at rest and during task suggests context-specific functional roles of the habenula, potentially contributing to default mode processes at rest and likely providing RPE signaling to salience network regions during tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PACE: Neuroimaging meta-analytics for addiction- Nodes, networks, and new heuristics</title>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite strong theoretical and clinical interest, characterization of the common and distinct neurobiological alterations across drug and behavioral addictions cannot be feasibly addressed within a single neuroimaging study. This research project will fill this knowledge gap by integratively using neuroimaging meta-analytic tools and a large amalgamated resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data set to rigorously characterize common (addiction- general) and distinct (drug/condition-specific) network-level brain alterations across addictive disorders. Available neuroimaging meta-analytic tools allow for synthesis of the extant literature and can be exploited to inform common and distinct neurobiological alterations across addiction. In addition, assessment of large-scale brain networks through (meta-analytic and rs-fMRI approaches) provides a more complete and coherent framework to appreciate such addiction-related alterations. As such, the innovative combination of such data streams offers the ability to inform heuristic frameworks guiding future research, fractionation of the addiction phenotype, and identification of neurobiological intervention targets. The overall objective of this project is to quantitatively synthesize the addiction-related neuroimaging literature (Aim 1), that then inform mega-analysis of a large amalgamated rs-fMRI data set (Aim 2), the behavioral interpretation of which will be facilitated by emerging meta-analytic techniques (Aim 3), thereby enabling cross-drug comparisons of network-level brain alterations. The feasibility of this overall analytic framework is evidenced by significant preliminary work in nicotine addiction. Specifically, this project will comprehensively synthesize the addiction-related neuroimaging literature to identify disrupted addiction-general and drug/condition-specific regional nodes across drug and behavioral addictions (e.g., alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, stimulants, opiates) and behavioral addictions (e.g., gambling, internet gaming) as well as obesity (Aim 1). Harnessing the accumulated volume of published neuroimaging results will allow for direct comparison of conditions that were never compared with each other in the primary studies. Meta-analytically informed hypotheses will be applied to an amalgamated rs-fMRI data set for targeted testing of altered functional connectivity across large-scale brain networks (Aim 2). To more fully contextualize the behavioral consequences of such alterations, we will employ network-level meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively delineate behavioral phenomena linked with regional and network-level alterations impacted by addiction (Aim 3). Efforts to archive, mine, and synthesize the accumulated knowledge of addictions impact on the brain are critical to inform analysis of large neuroimaging data sets generated through amalgamated sources or new data collection efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging research is increasing in volume and scope, needing “big data” methods for discovery. A number of important resources already exist for neuroimaging, including data repositories, crowd-sourcing knowledge bases, standardized ontologies and terminologies, and meta-analytic repositories. However, while data and code-sharing efforts are growing, there is little interaction and limited sharing of knowledge across platforms. Machine learning methods are being applied in other fields to extract knowledge locked in text (e.g., journal articles, patient records, social media posts), with the goal of recognizing relations among entities (e.g., “drug X causes adverse event Y”). Cognitive neuroscientists also determine relations, specifically between brain regions and cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes (e.g., “mental function X activates brain network Y”), but are hampered in using high-throughput automated methods on the ever-growing published text. It is not a simple process to identify which cognitive processes were studied in a given project, or what brain networks were identified as related to which mental process. The investigators propose an integrative metadata framework that describes the experimental design characteristics and results, as well as the knowledge that the research provides. Efficient knowledge sharing may best be achieved via an interactive data ecosystem that uses standards for transparency and openness when describing knowledge derived from cognitive neuroimaging experiments. Developing this integrative metadata framework for neuroimaging will increase the community’s ability to share data and evaluate reliability in the resulting relationships between mind and brain. This project aims to provide improvements in large-scale integration of the scientific literature, with more rapid understanding of the complexity of brain research and neurocognitive models, within an educational setting for training STEM students and accelerated research productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientific research frequently requires efficiency, transdisciplinary collaborations, and cross-domain flexibility. Efficient knowledge sharing may best be achieved via an interactive data ecosystem that relies on an integrative metadata framework. Such a framework would address scientific reproducibility by providing standards for transparency and openness when describing knowledge derived from cognitive neuroimaging experiments. Moreover, development of an integrative metadata framework for cognitive neuroimaging will enhance interaction between existing neuroinformatics resources, increasing the community’s ability to share data and evaluate reliability in experimental findings. This project will develop knowledge modeling tools for cognitive neuroimaging studies, as well as large-scale meta-analytic evaluations of cognitive models. The investigators will build on previous work extracting experimental design features from the text to create an ensemble of classifiers for full text papers. The investigators will work with an External Advisory Board for evaluation and feedback, and will use the framework to automatically extract knowledge regarding mind/brain models within the exemplar domains of executive function, affective processing, and reward feedback. The investigators will integrate classifiers and methods with other international standards for data and results sharing (e.g., NI-DM, CEDAR and ISA-TAB, BioCaddie) and other repositories (e.g. Neurosynth, BrainSpell) for broader use in the community. The intellectual merit of this project is the enhanced access to cognitive neuroscience knowledge that is currently locked in text. This project’s success will allow the research community to collectively address hurdles such as annotating their own data and sharing their data/results via integrated annotations in a public repository, journal, or knowledge discovery platforms, and ultimately lead to long-term strategies for cross-domain neurocognitive model development. This project has been designed to have high integrative value and will interact, harmonize, and share data and algorithms with existing neuroinformatics resources that will benefit from enhanced knowledge modeling techniques. Moreover, in an effort to promote transparency, reliability, and reproducibility, this project will be publicly available on the Open Science Framework and Github (e.g., Labels, Classifiers, Code). Such an integrative metadata framework may be viewed as the connective tissue that will facilitate a new generation of cognitive model development, providing a potentially transformative strategy for modeling the literature, and ultimately leading to more informed, evidence-based, and reproducible neurocognitive models of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the array of behavioral processes associated with the insula (e.g., cognition, emotion, interoception), delineating functionally distinct insular sub-regions has been of increasing interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior parcellation studies utilizing resting-state fMRI data have suggested a functional mosaic along an anterior (cognition) to posterior (sensorimotor) dimension. Here, we employed a task-dependent, data driven approach to delineate insular subdivisions based on coactivation patterns across thousands of neuroimaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we fractionated the human insular cortices by implementing the coactivation based parcellation (CBP) methodology in conjunction with the BrainMap database. We further used the BrainMap taxonomy of metadata terms for decoding the possible functional specialization of CBP generated clusters. We hypothesized that the insular cortex would parcellate into functional subdivisions with differential coactivation and behavioral profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Habenula activity following positive and negative feedback among abstinent cigarette smokers</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/flannery-habenula-poster"/>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The habenula (HB) inhibits dopamine-releasing neurons following the absence of an expected reward [1, 2], possesses a high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [3], and is linked with reward processing and the aversive effects of nicotine withdrawal and high nicotine doses [3, 4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While preclinical evidence has demonstrated the HB’s role in nicotine withdrawal [4, 5], the small size of the HB limits assessment of this region in human fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we examined a response-feedback task shown to differentially activate the HB as well as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventral striatum (VS) among nonsmoking participants [6]. As an initial step towards characterizing the impact of smoking status on the activity of the HB and these other regions, we aimed to confirm task-related fMRI effects among abstinent smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is a meditative technique that utilizes observation of interoceptive processes e.g., breath monitoring and open observation of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these methods employed, it has been postulated that this technique could be useful as a therapeutic intervention for some mental disorders characterized by displaced self or emotional awareness, as well as an inability to maintain focus on cognitive tasks, such as those who suffer from various forms of anxiety or drug addiction [1-4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a few meta-analytic studies have investigated the neural impact of various types of meditation [3,5,6], none have specifically compared and contrasted the functional and structural impacts of mindfulness techniques. Here, we sought to elucidate the functional and structural neurobiological impact of mindfulness manipulations through meta-analytic investigation using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) framework [7-9]. We hypothesized that mindfulness manipulations would enhance functional activation and gray matter volume in areas associated with attention monitoring (e.g., frontal cortex) and interoceptive processes (e.g., insula).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the NIH, this project utilizes fMRI to clarify how HIV infection and cannabis use (both alone and in combination) impact brain function. Lagging behind rapid changes to state laws, societal views, and medical practice is scientific investigation of cannabis’s impact on brain function, especially in patients with HIV/AIDS. We are addressing this knowledge gap by using advanced fMRI techniques to rigorously assess brain activity at the regional, network, and global levels in a sample of adults stratified by HIV-serostatus and cannabis use. Clarifying the impact of HIV infection and cannabis use on the brain is critically important for developing treatments to improve patients’ mental functions, identifying poor candidates for medical marijuana, and providing patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers with scientific information allowing for informed decision-making regarding cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most cigarette smokers endorse a desire to quit and half try to do so each year, the vast majority will relapse within days of a quit attempt due to withdrawal symptoms. Emerging evidence has critically linked the habenula, a small and understudied brain region with reward processing, tobacco addiction, and nicotine withdrawal. Specifically, the habenula inhibits dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain following the absence of expected reward and also plays a role in dopamine neurotransmission. The current study plans to investigate the activation of the habenula and other brain areas implicated in nicotine withdrawal during a positive and negative performance feedback task, the motion prediction task. This presentation shows preliminary fMRI data from 24 abstinent smokers performing the motion prediction task. The behavioral results of the motion prediction task validated the task’s utility in this population. Additionally, the habenula, bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate all displayed increased activation following negative performance feedback while the ventral striatum displayed increased activation to positive performance feedback and decreased activation to negative performance feedback. In the future, this study will compare abstinent smokers’ task-related activation with that of nonsmoking controls. In addition, this study will investigate whether two pharmacological smoking cessation aids, varenicline and nicotine, can reduce these task-related brain activation differences in abstinent smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeling how students think about physics is often measured via observation of students solving physics problems [1]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may inform how these processes occur, but currently no neuroimaging studies have examined how students develop physics problem-solving skills. To provide insight into the neural nature of physics learning we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in brain regions associated with problem-solving. Meta-analysis identified the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as the region most consistently implicated across problem-solving tasks. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired pre/post instruction in 8 undergraduate, first-time enrollees in introductory physics. Correspondence between post-instruction rsFC and meta-analytic results suggests a semester of university physics may facilitate enhanced recruitment of posterior brain regions involved in reasoning. Increased IFG-correlated activity from pre to post instruction indicates intrinsic brain connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project, to be conducted by researchers at Florida International University, will extend the research base and theory behind Modeling Instruction (MI), a curriculum intervention for college-level physics. The project is based on the idea that different teaching approaches in physics (MI versus traditional lectures) will lead to different student knowledge, which leads to observable differences in brain structures associated with physics reasoning. The project will also examine gender differences in physics learning. This project will advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying the neural and cognitive basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will use fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain activity, focusing on brain regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus (all associated with fact retrieval), medial and lateral prefrontal cortices and medial and right posterior parietal cortices (all associated with reasoning). Additional neural measures will assess functional brain connectivity, as a measure of neural efficiency of reasoning. The project will also employ behavioral and educational measures of intelligence, anxiety, and physics knowledge, including the FCI (Force Concept Inventory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, there has been a growing interest in the complex topology of human functional brain networks. Resting state (RS) and task-based (TB) fMRI provide complementary information regarding the human connectome, while meta- analysis provides an opportunity to assess convergence of task- based co-activation across a wide range of cognitive domains. Graph analysis offers a powerful means for characterizing brain networks; however, it is not yet clear what the optimal parameterization is for application to functional neuroimaging data. Specifically, node selection plays a critical role; however, this analysis stage has not been fully examined. Here, we investigated the effects of three node parcellation schemes on their respective RS and BrainMap TB graphs. We predicted that brain graphs based on functionally derived nodes are more informative than those using anatomically derived nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Physics Learning Facilitates Enhanced Resting State Connectivity in Problem Solving Network</title>

   <updated>2015-06-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing educational research seeks to optimize effective strategies for training undergraduate students who seek to enter the STEM workforce. To this end, physics education research studies socio-cognitive models of how students think about physics to facilitate meaningful learning, which is often measured via physics problem solving abilities. No neuroimaging studies to date have examined the mechanisms by which students learn scientific problem-solving skills in a STEM discipline, although a recent resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) study [1] observed increased coupling between neural areas implicated in reasoning among participants who received long- term reasoning training. Thus, to provide insight into the neural mechanisms of STEM learning in physics, we examined rsFC in brain regions associated with problem solving skills. We hypothesized that extensive scientific training in problem solving as part of a college-level introductory physics course would alter rsFC in a single student cohort when assessed across a semester of instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resting state fMRI data (12-min) were acquired in 8 healthy, right-handed participants (4 female, 4 male; aged 18-21) on a 3T GE 750W scanner. Participants were undergraduates at Florida International University who held a GPA&amp;gt;2.5 and were first- time enrollees in a college-level introductory physics course. The 13-week course emphasized training in problem solving skills; students completed one fMRI session at the beginning of the semester (pre-instruction) and a second identical session at the end of the semester (post-instruction).
To identify candidate neural regions for further analysis, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis [2] on studies investigating the neural correlates of problem solving in mathematical, verbal, and visuospatial domains (Fig. 1). A mask of the ROI representing the strongest convergence across domains was extracted. Subject-level seed-based correlation analyses were carried out using the meta-analytic mask as a seed region. Analyses were performed in FSL using FEAT, registration to structural images was carried out using FLIRT, and task-free functional connectivity maps were generated and thresholded at a significance of P&amp;lt;0.05 for clusters of z&amp;gt;2.3 using FLAME [3-5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ALE meta-analysis identified the dorsal aspect of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as most consistently implicated across problem solving domains. Seed-based correlation
results indicated that the left IFG exhibited significant rsFC with the left middle frontal and precentral gyri across both pre- and post-instruction. Pre-instruction revealed IFG- correlated activity in a relatively broader region of the anterior aspect of the middle frontal gyrus, as compared to post-instruction. Additionally, while pre-instruction showed a small volume in the medial precuneus, post-instruction revealed much larger extent across the left precuneus and superior parietal lobule, from the inferior parietal lobule into the supramarginal gyrus (Fig. 2). Overall, Fig. 3 illustrates minimal overlap between pre-instruction and the parietal meta-analytic network associated with problem solving, while post-instruction results suggest left-lateralized recruitment of this network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed-based correlation analyses on pre- and post-instruction resting state data from a cohort of introductory-level college physics students revealed differential patterns of rsFC using a seed located in the left IFG. Correspondence between post-instruction and meta-analytic results suggests that a semester of physics facilitates enhanced recruitment of the posterior parietal cortex as a result of the development of problem solving skills. The observed changes in IFG-correlated activity in pre- vs. post-instruction data are consistent with the notion that intrinsic connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience at the university level.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Students from Key Point Academy at First Presbyterian Church in Miami (Brickell, Florida) took a field-trip to Florida International University’s Modesto Maidique Campus. During their visit, the students toured the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum outdoor exhibits. Afterward, Dr. Angela Laird (Director) led the kindergarteners and first-graders through a “brain science” presentation, which highlighted “being a scientist,” brain health, and others. After the presentation, lab members facilitated a “brain hats” activity, designed to help students learn the major lobes of the brain, their general function, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Common and distinct functional alterations across anxiety disorders: An ALE meta-analysis</title>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional neuroimaging has contributed important insights into the neurobiological bases of complex neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders [1, 2]. While multiple anxiety disorders have been consistently linked with hyperactivity in the amygdala and insula (“emotion generation” regions), less clear is a link with hypoactivity in medial and lateral prefrontal cortices (“emotion regulation” regions). For example, a previous meta-analysis observed that whereas post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) were both associated with amygdalar and insular hyperactivity, only PTSD was linked with hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal, but not lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) [1]. As such, we meta-analyzed fMRI studies to more fully characterize common and distinct hyper- and hypoactivation patterns across anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Towards a prediction of cognitive deficits based on underlying connectivity differences in schizophrenia</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in schizophrenia (SZ) exhibit aberrant resting state connectivity based on regional temporal correlations relative to healthy subjects [Fornito et al., 2012]. We examined ICNs displaying abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia in an rsfMRI study and related them to similar networks extracted from the BrainMap database. BrainMap meta-analyses have identified several reliable and meaningful circuits of coactivations, i.e., areas commonly reported together in various neuroimaging analyses [Laird et al., 2013]. These circuits have been linked to coactivation networks in resting state datasets, leading to the hypothesis that they represent intrinsic networks underlying cognitive processes [Laird et al., 2011]. Here, we provide a new method of linking resting state connectivity differences to predicted cognitive deficits using metadata archived in the BrainMap database.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Intrinsic connectivity and behavioral parcellation of the cerebellum through meta-analytic modeling</title>
   <link href="https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/riedel-cerebellum-poster"/>
   <updated>2013-06-17T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>https://SkinMicrobe.github.io/smoothlab/posters/riedel-cerebellum-poster</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analytic methods have recently been developed that pool results from a broad range of independently published experiments to draw statistically significant conclusions about brain connectivity. These meta-analytic co-activation patterns provide results that are analogous to resting state functional connectivity maps, but the behavioral specificity of the observed patterns may be examined from the behavioral conditions employed in the contributing task-specific experiments. MACM provides an opportunity to model the connectivity of cerebellar structures from a functional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regions of the cerebellum were defined according to the probabilistic atlas developed by Diedrichsen et al. (2009), as this is the best and most widely accepted structural parcellation strategy of the human cerebellum.
Sleuth was used to search the BrainMap database for all experiments, under the context of normal mapping, reporting a coordinate of activation within each of the cerebellar structures. The following structures were omitted from further analysis due to insufficient data: X, Dentate, Fastigial, and Interposed of the Left and Right hemispheres, and VIIa Crus I, VIIa Crus II, VIIb, VIIIb, and X Vermis. GingerALE was then used to generate a MACM for each of the remaining 21 cerebellar structures based on the coordinates reported from each Sleuth search.
Structures with similar connectivity patterns were identified through hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of a correlation matrix of the cerebellar MACMs. In a separate, but parallel analysis, metadata histograms were created by determining the number of coordinates reported for each behavioral domain, paradigm class, and stimulus type that were located within each cerebellar structure.  Then, structures with similar metadata properties were identified through HCA of a correlation matrix of the metadata histograms. The “correlation” distance method, and “complete” linkage methods were used to produce a dendrogram from which the clusters of structures were visually identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dendrograms produced from each clustering analysis (Figure 1) may be examined from a two-cluster or four-cluster solution.
Two distinct clusters with cophenetic distances greater than 1.5 can be visually identified in each dendrogram. The top cluster in the Behavioral Metadata histogram shows 88% concordance with the top cluster in the MACM-Based Connectivity histogram. The bottom cluster in the Behavioral Metadata histogram shows 77% concordance with the bottom cluster in the MACM-Based Connectivity histogram. Interestingly, the clusters do not show preference toward lateralization. The two clusters may further be decomposed into four distinctly different clusters. The clusters in the Behavioral Metadata histogram show 100%, 67%, 67%, and 40% concordance, respectively, with the clusters in the MACM-Based Connectivity histogram.
Behaviorally, the first cluster of the four-cluster solution in the MACM-Based Connectivity analysis shows preference toward emotion, the second shows preference toward action and perception, the third cluster shows uniform behavioral preference, and the fourth cluster shows preference toward interoception, pain, and cognition. Additionally, the clusters from the Behavioral Metadata analysis showed similar behavioral preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity of the human cerebellum was explored through MACM, and HCA was used to identify those structures with similar connectivity patterns. Additionally, clusters with similar structural contribution were identified through HCA of cerebellar structure metadata histograms. The cerebellum has been believed to be a functionally homogeneous structure, however, behavioral preferences have been inferred for clusters of cerebellar structures.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Connectivity-Based Parcellation of the Frontal Pole</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frontal pole (FP) of the human brain, o6en referred to as BA 10, is known to be involved in various higher order cognitive processes. While this region has evolved expended from apes to humans, its precise functional specialization remains unclear. Previous cytoarchitectural studies of the FP in humans have shown that this portion of cortex contains two distinct cytoarchitectonic regions. Given that histological differences should be accompanied by different connectivity and functions, the frontal pole qualifies as a candidate for exploratory parcellation into functionally discrete subregions.
Our approach employs meta-analytic connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) methods in which voxels within a specified region are clustered based on their co-activation profiles arising in functional neuroimaging studies in the BrainMap database (Eickhoff et al., 2011). This analysis provides a quantitative method for identifying sub-regions and localizing functional specialization within a large volume of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
